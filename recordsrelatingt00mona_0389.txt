Olonmacnoise, where it now is. On the occasion 01 a visit to
that venerable ruia, in J uly, 1881, the Very Rev, Pius Devine,
01 the Congregation 01 St. Paul 01 the Oross, called the writer’s
attention to the shaft just referred to. It was then as it now
is, standing erect amon gst some 01 the inscribed stones at Clon-
macnoise. Mr. Kieran Molloy, who was showing us over the
ruins, knew nothing 01 its history, except that it was placed
there by the directions 01 Mr. Graves. Father Pius having
examined it, made some remarks, which led the compiler to
inquire still more regarding it, and his researches resulted in
finding out that it is the old crosa 01 Banagher. This is one
01 my many pleasing recollections 01 that visit made on the
occasion 01 a mission given at Ologhan, King’s County, in J uly,
1881, by the Rev. F athers Pius Devine, Oolomban O'Grrady,
Eustace and Ildefonsus‚ the good effects 01 which are still
visible in the united parishes 01 Banagher and Ologhan.

THE GREAT CROSS OF CLONMACNOISE

Is called by most writers on this subject Oros-na-Sceaptra,
or the Oross 01 the Scriptures, under which name it is noticed
in the Annals 01 Tighernach‚ at the year 1060, in the following
words: “ The Elians and the Hy—Focertei plundered Clonmac-
noise and carried away many captives from Oros-na·Sceapt1-a,
and slew two persons there, zze„ a student and another youth ;
but Grod and Giaran incited the Delvins in pursuit 01 them;
and they slaughtered them, together with the heir-apparent 01
Hy-Focarta, 101· it was he that killed the student. Their cap-
tives also returned to them at rising time on the day following
to Oluain, through the miracles 01 Oiaran.'' This cross was
erected 101· two purposeS, viz, as a memorial 01 the erection 01
the Cathedral 01 Olonmacnoise, and as a sepulchral monument
01 the Monarch Flann. The cathedral and it are coeval.
Both afford ample evidence that the Irish were experts in the
art 01 sculpture, in the beginning 01 the tenth century, and
were fully competent to apply it to architectural purposes.
The age 01 this cross and the object 101· which it was erected,
may be determined by the names 01 the Abbot Colman and 01
the Monarch F lann, which are engraved upon it. The first 01

these inscriptions occurs on a tablet, on the west 11οἒ1ἓ 01 the
