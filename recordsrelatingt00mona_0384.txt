virtues and sufferings should never be forgotten by the future
historian of our calamitous times. ν
“That illustrious individual sprang from the noble house of
his name, which for many an age ruled with princely sway in
Breffny-O’Reifly. At a very early period of his life he dis-
tinguished himself as a jurist, for, indeed, he was profoundly
versed in the canon and civil law. Family influence and talents
vsuch as his would, doubtless, have raised him to eminence had
he chosen a secular career3 but, caring little for the fame or
ffiortune which he might have won so easily in the senate or in
‘the forum, he renounced the world, and took our poor habit in
‘the Convent of Cavan. His piety, learning, and prudence were
the theme of every tongue; and although he never left Ireland
or sought for himself any dignity, the Supreme Pontiff pro-
moted him to the Bishopric of Ardagh, on the 23rd of J anuary,
1576. Resigm'ng that diocese, he was translated to the See of
JKilmore, and held the office of Vice—Primate after the death oi:
Raymond O'Grallagher, Bishop of Derry‚ who was slain by the
English in 1601. It may not be superfluous to inform you that,
during the vacancy of the See of Armagh, or the absence of its
Metropolitan, the office of Vice-Primate has, according to im-

province. Thus, O’Gallagher succeeded to that dignity when
Edmund M‘Gauran fell in an action fought by M‘Gruire, Prince
'of Fermanagh, against the troops commanded by Bingham,
President of Connaught3 and when the Bishop of Kilmore
departed this life, Cornelius O'Deveny, the martyred Bishop of
Down and Connor‚ fiUed the vacant place. I have deemed it
necessary to make these remarks lest such a venerable usage
should be forgotten. Now let me resume my narrative of our
bishop's life. He dwelt constantly in Multifernan, and never
left it except on the business of his diocese, when he always
preferred such accommodatiori as he could find in some house of
our Order, to the comforts and hospitality which he might have
received from the Oatholic nobility and gentry. During his
vresidence among us, he invariably wore the habit, partook of
>such fare as our poor refectory afforded, and never dined apart
from the common table of the friam, except when strangers
were entertained in the guest-house. His entire retinue con-
sisted of his confessor, chaplain, and two boys, who attended him
when saying Mass. I had frequent opportunities of witnessing
‘the austerities he practised, and can vouch that Franciscan never
lived who took greater delight in obeying the rigid ordinances
of our holy founder. Even when broken down by old age and
infirmities, he could not be induced to wear a coarse linen shirt;
und despite all remonstrances of our friars, he rejected any little
