entablature, and the tower, which, when erected, will, of course,
require to be furnished with a clock and bells. These works‚ so
essential to give to the building its proper expression and
character as a church-like structure, must necessarily cost a
large amount. They must be in due keeping with the colossal
proportions of the main building3 and consisting of elaborately-
wrought details, they must be expensive even beyond their
magnitude. Ι might add several minor works‚ which are un-
avoidable, in order to give completeness to so large an edifice;
and as nothing can be out of proportion‚ each of these will
make a large item in the outlay. Ι desire, dearly beloved
brethren, to be undisguised in stating the task we have before
us. Ι am persuaded that in doing so, so far from discouraging
yon, Ι am presenting to you a motive to excite your zeal and
generosity. Such was the argument of holy David, when ani-
mating the people to contribute to the erection of the great
temple of Jerusalem: “ The work, indeed, is great,'' he used to
say ; “ a house is prepared not for man, but for God.''

In making this demand upon the generosity of the diocese,
Ι am encouraged by two assuranceS, as gratifying as they are
unquestionable. The one is, that WE CAN Accomrmsrr THE TAsK
of finishing our Cathedral3 the other, that we all WISH AND
EARNESTLY DESIRE To SEE IT FINISHED.

We can accomplish this glorious task. It is a heavy task,
yet, with God's help, we are equal to it. If necessary, Ι could
show, by a simple process of calculation, which would divide
the expense over the Catholic property of the diocese, what a
small sum, what a mere trifle in proportion to our means, each
of us would have to pay in order to realise the required amount.
Ι prefer, however, simply stating the fact, which, Ι am sure,
no one will hesitate to admit, that WE CAN finish our Oathedral.
Ι am aware that in almost every parish there are demands for
works connected with religion, in one form or other, in the
parish. Of this Ι am aware3 and I am exceedingly consoled
to witness a holy rivalry amongst you in your generous en-
deavours to promote the interests of religion, in every way that
your> zealous clergy call upon you. Nevertheless, Ι am per-
suaded that, without prejudice to local purposes, you will find
means to respond tofthis appeal. In this parish we have special
objects to promote, distinct from the Cathedral‚ yet the good
and generous people of Longiord are preparing, with their
accustomed liberality, to give an example to the entire diocese,
in the effortnow to be made for the Cathedral. Ι will, there-
sore, reiterate the fact—there is nothing impossible, nothing
even difficult in what we propose. Let us only divide the work
amongst us, and let every hand be reached forth with the of-
fering of ⁴⁶ a cheerful giver,'’ and the work is accomplished.
