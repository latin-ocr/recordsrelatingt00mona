CATHEDRAL AND COLLEGE OF ARDAGH. 7

the interior, and the present Bishop, Dr. WVoodlock, has made
still larger improvements and contemplates the erection of a
magnificent portico, which is a part of the original design.
Canon O'Hanlon‚ on the occasion of a visit in June, 1876, to
Longford, wrote the following description of St. Mers :——“ The
fine cathedraL dedicated to St. Mel, at Longford‚ is one of the
largest and handsomest ecclesiastical structures in Ireland. It
is built of the finest grey marble limestone, Which on the exterior
is cut and carefully dressed, from the foundation to the project-
ing course that crowns the walls. cut stone mouldings enclose
the windows exteriorly, and these are covered With moulded
pediments. Six pillars are intended to support a grand pedi-
ment in front‚ but this portion has yet to be erected. The style
throughout is os the Italian composite order. The ground plan
includes a nave, connecting two side aisles by a double range
of eleven arches, divided on either hand, resting on twelve grey
marble columns of great height, yet symmetrical and solid. The
columns are capped by chiselled capitals, under the turning of
the arches. A transept extends across the upper end of the
nave and side aisles. A grand high altar, of exquisitely white,
polished Carrara marble-of elaborate and congruent design
with the style of building—is in the centre, and opposite to the·
great entrance by the nave. At the end of the right side aisle
there is a side altar of our Holy Redeemer, and at the end of
the left side aisle there is one dedicated to the Blessed Virgin.
Transverse columns and arches are in the transepts. F our
circular-headed windows light either side aisle, and they
alternate with circular‚ canopied niches, all with fine mouldings
interiorly. Five such niches fill up the circular apse, behind
the front altar. A circular—headed window between similarly
designed nicheS, ornaments either end of the transept. Twenty
eight angels‚ wrought in a highly artistic manner, rise im-
mediately over the capitals of all the nave columns. The coved
roof of the ceiling is wrought very tastefully in plaster, While
a highly ornamenta] cornice runs over the whole circuit of nave
and apse in the same elaborate style. High in the coved
ceiling, over the three large entrance vestibules‚ is the fine-toned
organ of the choir. Two fine columns, with three connecting
arches, support the organ loft and choir. The vestibuleS‚ in
frent, lead to the nave and aisles. A moulded cornice runs
immediately under the window sills all through the cathedral.
Twelve clerestory and circular—headed lights are over their
respective colonade arches on either side of the nave. The
· bishop’s throne is on the Gospel side, within the sanctuary3
while the pulpita rises against the third circular column on the
epistle side of the nave. Basso-relievo flat columns are placed
