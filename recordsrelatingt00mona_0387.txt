grasps the hair 01 the figure immediately preceding it. Their
respective right hands hold the beard 01 the figure immediately
in the rere.

“ The sides 01 the stone are ornamented with an interlaced
tracery, some 01 which resembles serpents. This tracery it
would be difficult, if not wholly impossible, to describe in words.
The character 01 it is that of similar ornaments found in various
carvings on stone 01 the tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth
centuries.

“ The most remarkable object on the back 01 the stone is some
sort of mythic combination shaped like an animal with a non·
descript head, but rudely resembling that 01 a hawk. The ears
seem to be represented by the heads 01 two serpents‚ whose
bodies are twined into trinodal and circular forms 01 curve. The

with anything like to this, excepting the figure on the brazen
talisman 110111 Hindostan, which I forwarded 101· inspection 01
the members 01 our useful society.

“ The stone I am describing appears to have been part 01 a
sepulchral or commemorative cross, set up at Banagher Well,
to record the death 01 Bishop William O’Duffy‚ who died by a
fall from his horse, A D. 1297. I read in the original English
edition 01 Ware’s ‘ Bishops,' published at Dublin, 1704, p. 29 :
‘ William O’Duffy, a minorite, after two years’ vacancy, suc-
·ceeded and was restored to the temporalities‚ Oct. 6th, 1290.
He was killed by a fall 110111 his horse, in 12973

“ Perpetuated on the stone, now being written 01, is the record
01 that fatal event, 101 011 it is to be seen a Bishop οη horsebaclc.
He is without (it is worthy 01 remark), either stirrups or saddle.
Above his lordship is the lion, the hieroglyphic 01 strength
and power, being emblematic 01 the Bishop's character and
authority, before the unfortunate accident befel him. Next to
this we find the red deer, taken in a trap and writhing in mortal
agony and distress. This is plainly symbolical 01 O'Duffy's
name and melancholy death. The Irish word om'nreu'), pro-
nounced nearly as 11 written Davefeei, or Duffy, signifies a red
deer. A letter written to me by my learned friend, the excel-
lent Irish scholar, Professor Owen conuallem, the 4th October,
1846, in answer to one from me, suggesting that the arose, 01
which this stone was a portion, had been erected in memory 01
Bishop O'Duffy's sudden death, runs as follows: ‘ Whether
the O'Duffy family derived their name 110111 a person called
*cmm-ero, or from some celebrated hunter who might, from
that circumstance, have obtained the epithet, is very difficult
to determine 3 ' and again, ‘The stone which you describe is
