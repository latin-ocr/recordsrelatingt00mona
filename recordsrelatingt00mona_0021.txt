DIOOESE OF ARDAGH.

ἥ..-

Some writers have erroneously stated that St. Mel was the
founder 01 the See 01 Ardagh. This See was founded by St.
Patrick, and its first Bishop was St. Mel. Oolgan A. S. S. p.
261, c. 9. col. 2, writes: “For he (St. Patrick) left Moel* in
Ardachadh, to the east, and his sister in Druuincheus, to the
west 01 the mountain called Bri-leith‚ lying between both
places.'' And in chapter 10 it is stated: “that St. Patrick
ἷὲἕθῗέἕὲἷθῖἓῖἶῖῗέεξῖἶθἃὲἕᾞπὲἷπῗῖἕέἷῖῧῗὲ’0ὲῖἷὲἓῖἱὲῗὲἰᾶὲῖ
called Ardachadh, which, to this very day, is the See of Ardagh,
and consecrated his sister's son, Melus, Bishop 01 it; with
whom he left Milchuo, Oo-Bishop. Milchuo was brother to
St. Melus. Mann is the progenitor 01 the people 01 Teffia.''

The Cathedral 01 Ardagh is justly reckoned amongst the
most ancient churches in Ireland. It was founded in 454. An
illustrious champion and preacher 01 the Grospel was placed over
it. His name Mel, or Melus, suggests those honeyed stores of
divine wisdom and celestial virtues which had been laid up 111
his mind. He was not only Bishop, but also Abbot of this
church. For as Ware remarks, “in the infancy 01 Ohristianity
in Ireland the bishoprics and abbeys were frequently blended
together, and such ecclesiastice as were consecrated bishops often
resided both as abbots and bishops. Under the first title they
governed their monks, and, as bishops‚ they had the country
about the monastery under their care, to ordain priests, and.
execute other parts 01 the episcopal functions.''

The “ Trias Thaum.,'’ p. 227, contains the following remark-
able statement: “St. Mel, the son 01 Darerca, sister 01 St.
Patrick, who was the mother 01 seventeen bishOPS‚ one of whom
was St. Mel, Bishop of Ardachadh in Tffa.'' Again, the same
authority contains the' following statement : “ The virtuous sons
01 Darerca are found seventeen foreign bishops and two daugh-
ters, viz. : Achea, who raised the dead and cured the lepers ; and
Lalloca‚ 01 Lenlios behind Mount Bradgna.’' This high authority
does not tell us that Motlzevg in the previous sentence, is to be

*⁵ Maol, in Irish, signifies the man of the large tonsure.
