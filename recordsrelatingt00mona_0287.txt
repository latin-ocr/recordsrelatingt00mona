DR. KILDUFF. 267‘

under a calm, subdued, and humble demeanour there burned an
ardent and holy zeal for the advancement of religion and virtue„
and an iron will, associated with an untiring energy, that.
enabled him to overcome difficulties the most formidabie, andi
achieve great and glorious results. In aftertime, men may askt
what monument did a grateful people run up to the memory of‘
such a benefactor, and it may be said, that he built a monus
ment to himself in the hearts of his flock, in the virtues that
he developed in them, and which they will transmit to their·
children's children. This was the only memorial he aspired to„
but others will remain in the magnificent cathedral which he
all but completed, the diocesan seminar-y which he caused tos
be erected on the fine, well-wooded land adjoining the church ;.
the spacious schools for the education of the poor, the con--
vent for the Sisters of Mercy, and the beautiful temples
devoted to the worship of God, which he caused to be erected.
throughout the length and breadth of the diocese. The town,
yesterday‚ was crowded by the people, even from remote parts
of the country, and an air of gloom and sadness hung over·
all as they spoke of the departed prelate in language the most
tender and expressive of the deep and irreparable loss which
they had sustained.

The remains were borne from the seminary‚ where the good
bishop closed his honoured life, to the cathedral‚ after last
Mass yesterday. From Friday evening, up to yesterday, the
remains lay in the exquisite N orman chapel attached to the
college, attired in his pontificals. The sad hearers of the
remains were four of the clergy of the town, followed by a
vast crowd. All that was mortal of the departed were received
at the principal entrance of the noble pile by the choir of'
priests in attendance, who preceded the remains to the place-
prepared for them in the choir. The psalms prescribed by the
Ritual for such an occasion having been chaunted, the Office for
the Dead was recited throughout the night. From an early
hour this morning all the roads leading to the town were
thronged by persons of all classes coming to take part in the-
solemn ceremonial, and to attend the funeral. Every shop andr
place of busin ess remained closed, without a single exception, and,
the townspeople of allvdenominations did everything in their
power to mark their deep respect and veneration for the memory
of the deceased prelate. At the high and side altars, Mass was
celebrated from five o'clock till noon, the time fixed for the
Office of the Dead to commence. The weather was extremely
fine, and the exterior of the cathedral presented a grand and
imposing effect, with its dome and cross-surmounted campanile,
rising in classic grace and beauty in the midsummer sunshine.
