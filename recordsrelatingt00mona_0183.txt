unanimously requested by the assembled bishops to set out for
Rome and represent their views. The deputed bishops accepted
their commission with some reluctance, and departed for Rome
soon after Easter. On the l2th of April Dr. O'Higgins wrote
in high spirits from Marseilles‚ that they had arrived there
safely the previous night, were to leave probably the next day,
and expected to be in Rome on the following Sunday afternoon.
An unexpected and almost fatal circumstance unfortunately
intervened. It was a narrow escape from drowning‚ under
the following circumstances. Having reached Oivita Vecchia‚
in the afternoon of the next day, Dr. O'Higgins was walk-
ing by the seashore with some ecclesiastical dignitaries
and observed a ship on the point of being wrecked by a
great storm. The bishop said it would be well to give the
crew absolution in their extreme danger. On reflection it
occurred to him that the distance was too great for the words
to have effect. A few sailors had. a boat close by. The bishop
hired the boat and started at once to the sinking vessel. He
reached in time to give the crew absolution en masse. Directly
he had finished the act of absolution a wave swept over the
small boat in which he stood and carried him into the sea. He
struggled with the waves as best he could for a few minutes,
and was upon the point of being drowned when one of the crew
jumped from the vessel saying, “I will risk my own life to
save the bishop’s.’' This sailor had a rope tied round his body,
and gallantly swam out and. rescued Dr. O’Higgins from a watery
grave. On inquiry it turned out the courageous sailor was a
County Roscommon man. N ext day the bishops started for
Rome. Here they encountered some difficulties, for the question
of the Queen’s Colleges was at that time truly a vexed question.
Dr. Wiseman, then residing at Rome, and Dr. N icholson‚ Arch—
bishop of Corfu, and Dr. Ennis, a highly respectable parish
priest of the Diocese of Dublin, and then in Rome, did not take
the same view of the educational question as Drs. MacHale and
O’Higgins. Rome is proverbially slow3 being for all time, she
need not be in a hurry. Eight or nine months passed over
before a final pronouncement was made. On the l4th of
September, Dr. O’Higgins wrote to Dr. Maginn, Bishop of
Derry, “ We have at length left our final eoepose} in print with
the Pope and cardinale. The case will be discussed on the 25th
of this month in a full Gongregation‚ and the opinions of their
Eminences will be laid before the Pope on the following
Sunday.” Shortly after the Pope issued a Rescript to the Irish
Bishops, renewing his condemnation of the Queen's Colleges‚
and requesting them to erect a Catholic University similar to
that in Louvain. It is oreditable to Ardagh that its bishop
