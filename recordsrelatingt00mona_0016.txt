viii PREFACE.

conscious of how imperfectly Ι have accomplished the object Ι
placed before myself, viz.‚ to collect and publish a fairly read-
able record of the names os the prelates that succeeded SS. Mel
and Kieran, in the government of Ardagh and Olonmacnoise,
down to the present time ; to accentuate the chief ecclesiastical
events occurring within the limits of these dioceses, during their
episcopate‚ and to touch remarkable historic facts that took
place outside the boundaries of their Sees, but with which they
had notable connection. The task was certainly a laborious one,
and in some respects a thankless one. It is a branch of litera-
ture commanding only a very limited number of votaries.
From its admirers Ι confidently expect an indulgent sympathy
in condoning the shortcomings and defects of: these collections.

Το all others Ι say—

·'‘ Oh, blame me not if Ι love to dwell on Ardagh's early glory ;
Oh, blame me not, if too oft I tell the same inspiring story.
’Tis much to know that our loved saints then
To their cloisters the strangers drew,

And taught the Goth and Saxon men

All of heaven the old earth knew.

’Tis much to know that in the lVest,

The sun of our wisdom rose,

And the barbarous clouds that scarred its breast,
Were scattered like baffied foes ;

To know that in our hearts there dwell,

Some seeds of the men of story.

“ Oh, blame me not if Ι love to tell.
Of Ardagh’s ancient glory.'’

-ΙΒΕΝΕ,

In conclusion, Ι gratefully thank the many kind friends
who assisted me, by written or oral instruction, by the loan of
books, or otherwise aided me in this undertaking. Prominently
amongst them I shall always remember his Eminence cardinal

Moran, Archbishop of Sydney3 the Right Rev. Dr. Wood-
lock, Lord Bishop of Ardagh and Olonmacnoise ; the Right Rev.
Dr. Healy‚ Bishop of Clonfert3 the Very Rev. Dr. Bugler,
P.P., V.G., Birr3 the Very Rev. Dr. Gargan, V.P. ἅτ V.G., St.
