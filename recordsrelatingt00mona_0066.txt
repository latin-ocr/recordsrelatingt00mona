46 Diocnsn OF ’ ARDAGH.

It is stated in ancient records that the king not only aided
the saint with his own hands in the erection of the sacred edifice,
but also in the construction of the humble cell adj oining, in which
Ciaran lived and died.

The king was to the saint, in a temporal sense, friend, brother
and father Το Oiaran, Diarmid was a beloved name, “ Carum
et venerablile nomen.'‘ For there was another Diarmid, and he
was his spiritual teacher, friend and father. St. Diarmid, of the
Seven Church Island, Lough Ree, in the Shannon, was he. He
was not only Oiaran's spiritual director and teacher for a time,
but he also baptized him*

Assuming this statement to be an historical fact (and it is
supported by respectable authorities), it would favour the opinion
asserting Mag Ai, County Roscommon, to be the birthplace of
Oiaran. For St. Diarmid lived and died in Inis-clothran, or
Inchclerdun, now commonly known as Seven Ohmch, or Quaker's
Island. The latter name it got, because⁴ a Quaker took up his
residence 011 it some years ago. Bathed by the spreading and
maj estic waters of the Shannon in Lough Ree, this island ad-
joins Roscommon, and would be within easy distance of Mag
Ai‚ for the baptismal regeneration of Ciaran.

I cannot leave this truly romantio and charming spot, and
St. Diarmid, without recording what Mr. O'Donovan tells us he
heard on the occasion of his visit to these parts, when engaged
011 the Ordnance Survey. He States that the boatmen (three in

 

The Life adds : ‘· It was on the lOth of the Kalends of February that Ciaran
took up his abode in Clonmicnoise, 011 the lOth of the moon, a Saturday. Eight
persons formed the company, viz. :—-Ciaran, Aenghus, Nac N isse, C aelcholun1‚
Mulioc, Lugna, Mac hui Mogalaim, and Colman mac N uin. XVhen Ciaran
planted the first post of the Cathair of Clonmicnoise‚ Diarmaid Mac Cerbhaill,
who was present, joined him in his work. Ciaran blessing him said, ·‘ Though
few are your companions to-day, to-morrow thou shalt be the King of Erin.''
This was verified, for on that night, Tuathal Maelgarbh, King of Erin, was
killed, and Maelmor, who slew Tuathal, was immediately slain, and Diarmaid
was summoned to assume the sovereignty. This king proved himself grateful
to St. Ciaran and his brethren, and bestowed on him rich gifts of land, and no
fewer than one hundred churches. After commemorating some miracles of our
saint, the Life thus continues : ‘⁶ Only four months did Ciaran dwell in the
newly-erected monastery, when his soul went to heaven, on the ninth day iu
the middle month of the harvest. WVhen his death approaohed, he prophesied
with great sorrow, that wicked people would wage a bitter persecution against
his monastery, towards the end of time, and he told his religious brethren not
to fix their thoughts on dwelling there, but to ¹turn their affections wholly to
heaven, that thus all might be united there. And Ciaran was in the Eclais
Beg (ie, the little church), when his death came upon him, in the 33rd year of
his age, on the fifth of the ides of September, on a Saturday, the fifteenth of
the moon’s age. He said, ‘ Let me be taken a little distance out,’ and when he
saw the wide expanse of heaven over him, he said, ‘ N arrow is the way which
leads to heaven.’ But the brethren who were with him said, ‘ N ot to you, O
