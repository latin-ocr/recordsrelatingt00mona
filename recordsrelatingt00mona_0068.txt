informs us, that an angel appeared to Oolomba and asked what
special virtues he desired most. The saintly youth replied that
he desired before all others “ virginity and wisdom.'' Not long
after, Oolomba being engaged 111 prayer, three maidens arrayed
in heavenly light, appeared before him. But the holy youth
heeded them not. They asked, “ dost thou not know us ?” He
was silent. “ We are the three sisters, Virmn-itys, Wlsdom, (md
Pae‘oplzecgs‚'' and we are sent by God to be your inseparable com-
panions during your earthly pilgrimage.''

At another time, while Ciaran and Golomba were engaged in
their studies under the same collegiate roof, two brilliant lights
were observed in the heavens, having their rays concentrated on
the monastery. One was silvery as the moon and the other
golden as the sun. The holy Abbot and Bishop Finnian, after--
wards stated in his explanation of this vision that Colomba
would be as the golden sun, whilst Ciaran Macantsoir would
shine as a silvery light on account of his virtues and his deeds.
The prophecy was literally verified. These two great and holy
men shone in their day, and, Ι may add, to the present time, the
0110 35 the sun and the other as the moon, in our collegiate and
monastic horizon. ,

And now my memory goes off to the Angelical Doctor and
the vision he had in the church os St. Dominick, at N aples. St.
Thomas was in the habit of praying 111 the church before the hour
for matins, and the friars were aware‚ but more especially F ather
Reginald, that the angelical received extraordinary favours-
from our Lord 011 511011 occasions. Fra Dominico being anxious

 

The same great saint when proeeeding to Iona wished to bring with him
two handfuls of clay from the grave of St. Ciaran. On getting into the eddy
of Corryvreckan‚ when there appeared to be no hope of safety‚ he threw this„
precious relic into the sea, and his boat passed unharmed through that danger
(Trias, page 457b, and Reeve’s Adamnan, pages 24 and 263). St. Columbkille
was only in his 30th year at the time of our saint's death, but we learn from
Adamnan that he in after life returned to visit the spot hallowed by his
remains. The religious went forth to welcome the bosom friend of their holy
patron. “The whole of them‚⁷' says Adamnan, “singing hymns and praises,
conducted him to the church, and to guard him as he walked from the pressure
of the multitude, a barrier, formed of pieces of wood bound together, was.
carried by four 111011, who timed their steps with his.'’

Almost all the ancient authorities, agree that St. Ciaran died at the early age
of thirty-three years. The various annals, however, do not agree in assigning the
year of the saint's death. The Chronicon Scotorum, however, which, being
composed in Clonmacnoise, is justly esteemed the most accurate and trust-
worthy of our records regarding this monastery, registers the birth of St.
Ciaran in the year 512 ε “ Nativitas Sancti Ciarani filii artificis,'’ and his death
111 the year 544. “Ciaran the Great, son of the carpenter, quievit in the thirty-
third year of his age, in the seventh month also after he began to build
Cluain-mic-Nois.'' This opinion has also in its favour that it was in 544
Diarmaid assumed the sovereignty of Ireland (See Dr. Todd's list of the
Monarchs of Ireland, in Memoir of St. Patrick, page 256); whilst, from the
life of our saint, it is manifest that the foundation of Clonmacnoise must be
