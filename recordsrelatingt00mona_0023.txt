DIOCEsE oF ARDAGH. 3

Some hold (and they are chiefly Anglo-Scottish writers) that
St. Bridget of Kildare was veiled by St. Macchilla, Bishop of
Sodor, in the Isle of Man, about the year 443. F ew now sub-
scribe to that opinion, which is erroneously founded on the
affinity of the names Macchilla and Maccalle, who were distinct
persons. The latter, as we shall hereafter see, had a hand in
the religious profession of Bridget. whilst the former was not
a bishop at all, nor even baptised‚ most probably, at the time
she was clothed in the religious habit.

A second class of writers, and they are more numerous and
important, contends that Bishop Maccalle, whose church was on
or about Croghan Hill, King’s CO„ performed the religious
profession, either &here or 011 the hill of Usney between Oastle-
town and Ballymore‚ in the Co. Westmeath. This opinion is not
so devoid of foundation as the former ; but it seems to me to be
incorrect, and to have derived its probability from the fact that
Maccaille assisted St. Mel, at Ardagh, in performing the reli-
gious ceremony.

A third class of writers holds that St. Mel profe-§secl St.
Bridget. Their arguments appear to me conclusive, although
Dr. Lanigan considered this opinion too absurd to need refutation.
Before formulating their views I shall give their nameS, viz:
Ultan,* in his “ Vita S. B1=igidae,’' Ware, by Harris, vol iii„ b. i.,
c. 3. p. 12. ; and Colgan in his ‘⁴ Trias Thaum.,’' 3rd life, S. B.‚
c. 18. Ι11 support of this opinion, Ι am happy to be able to cite
Eugene O'Curry and Professor B. O'Looney, whose scholarship,
on questions like the present, is beyond controversy. The follow—
ing is an extract from Eugene O'Curry’s translation of the life of
St.. Bridget‚ to be found in the Catholic University collection
of his MSS„ now preserved at Clonliffe College, “ Dubthach
said to his daughter, ‘ My daughter,’ said he, ⁶ take a veil upon
your head if you have dedicated your virginity to God‚ i shall
not deprive him of it.' Bridget now being anxious to have the
order of penance conferred upon her she went to Bm· Ez‘le† and
seven veiled women with her, having heard that Bishop Moel
was there. And when they had arrived there, the Bishop was
not there, but had gone into the country of the Ui N eill. She
went, therefore, on the next day, and Mae Caille leading the

²³ Ultan of Ard-Breccain collected the account of her virtues and miracles,
and commanded his disciple, Brogan, to put them in poetry.

† Bri-Eile, i.e , the Hm. of Croghan, in O’Conor Faly’s country. This hill is
celebrated by spenser in his “Fairy Queen.⁷⁷ Colgan and Lanigan have
asserted that Cruachan Bri-Eile, 011 which St. Mac Caille erected a church. in
the sixth century, was on the confines of Leinster and Munster 3 but O'Donovan
has proved, in a letter written at Tullamore, J anuary the 4th, 1838, now pre-
served at the Orclnance Survey office, Phoenix Park, that it is the Hill of

Croghan, which is on the confines of ancient Meath and Leinster‚ and 011 which
a small portion of the ruins of Mac Caille’s church is still visible.
