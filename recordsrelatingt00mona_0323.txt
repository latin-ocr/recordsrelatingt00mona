cessation of a correspondence which he had valued, and to which
comte himself attached great value (as appears in one of his
letters to me) inquiring into the cause of the silence, and show-

After 1842 a radical change took place, which marks a
period of immense importance in the history of Positivism. In
his Polite'que Positz‘vzste, and his Oateclzisme, he sets himself to
arrange individual and social life according to his own fancy.
Many of those who look upon his Plzilosoplzze as one of the
noblest works ever written, abandon himin 1118 Politzque and
Cateelzisme. Among such Positivists are Mr. John Mill, Mr.
Grote, Mr. Lewis, M. Littre. Others, again, place the Pontique
and C'ateclzisme far before the Philosophia. M. Littre, in order to-
justify his desertion of the master, after 1842, insinuatos, that
the works written after that date are vitiated, owing to a
second attack of insanity, which he supposes then took place.
If this argument be admitted, it is plain that not even the
Pltilosoplzie is entitled to any regard. For, beyond all doubt, it
was published after 3 fit of insanity, so serious and protracted
as to have at one time almost forbidden the hope of recovery. In
1852 he published the catechism Positisisz‘a Dr. Robinet, his
physician, has sketched the routine of his daily life in these his
later ears:—

“he rose at five in the morning, prayed, meditated‚ and
wrote till seven in the evening, with brief intervals 101· 1118
two meals. Every day he read a chapter from the Ιηιίέαΐὶοη
of Christ, and a Canto 01 Dante3 Homer also was frequently
re-read. Poetry was his sole relaxation, now that he could
no longer indulge his passion for the opera. From seven to
nine (and on Sundays 111 the afternoon) he received visits, espe-
cially from working men, among whom he found disciples.
On Wednesday afternoon, he visited the giave 01 Madame de>
Vaux. At ten he again prayed and went to bed. The hour of
prayer was to him an hour of my stic and exquisite expansion.
Nothing could be simpler than his meals; breakfast consisted
only of milk; dinner was more substantial, but rigorously
limited. At the close 01 dinner he daily replaced dessert by
a piece of dry bread, which he ate slowly, meditating on the
numerous poor who were unable to procure even that means of
nourishment in return for their work ” (p.p. 406-7.)

The Synthcse Subjectire he did not live to finish. He died on
the 5th of September, 1857, at the age of sixty.

The system elaborated by Μ. Comte has been developed by
many discipl‘es. Among these, M. Littre holds the chief
place. Convinced that theology and royalism are fast disap-
