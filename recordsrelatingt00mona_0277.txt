DR. KILDUFF. 257

the Holy Sacrifice. He brought that most energetic and sels-
sacrificing sisterhood, the Mercy Ν uns, to Longiord, gave them
his own residence‚ where they lived for some years, until they
had erected the present stately convent adj oining the railway.
That little community has already been the fruitful mother of the
Convents of Mercy at N ewtownforbes, Granard, Ballymahon,
and Mohill. From the very successful and promising convent
of the same Orcler at Moate, established by Dr. Kilduff, came forth
the thrivin g institution, conducted by the SISTERS at Ballymahon.

It must not be supposed that his great attention to practical
wants and details connected with them prevented his lordship
from keeping himself well up on the literature of the day, and
especially on theological and philosophical questions. Not
having been so much engaged in educational pursuits as his
eminent predecessor, Dr. O'Higgins, there does not exist such a
record of his learning. But Dr. Kilduff, as a theologian‚ was a
most learned man. He presided at all his Conferenoes‚ and made
them highly practical and interesting. The writer had the
advantage of reading his Theological and Scriptural Oourse at
Maynooth, the fame of whose professors is world-wide. The
least of them is, indeed, a giant in his own department. Their
trentam are read in the New, as well as in the Olcl World. Drs.
O’Hanlon, Murray, Oroly, Neville‚ and Molloy were the Profes-
sors of Theology in my time. Their fame is not confined to
Ireland. If, however, I were asked which of these great men
was the best and most useful professor, I should say Dr. (now
Illonsiynor) N eville, Dean of Oork. He taught his class the
pith of the tract in a clearer manner than any of the other pro—
fessors. He did not burden their intelleot and memory with
unnecessary and almost useless details. He did not obscure
his chief points by verbiage. He did not waste his energy and
the attention of his class on m'ee philosoplzieal and metaphysical
distinctions of scholastie writers (although, at the Dunboyne
Examinations, when a fitting occasion arose, he invariably
showed his skill and power in that department of soience, inves-
tigating, as he went on, principles and (carlom-5 to their very sources,
and pushing objections to their ultimate conclusione, thus revealing
the range and depth of his> innate ability and acquired know-
ledge); in which, perhaps, the twelve premium men could not
all follow him3 and the result was, his students remembered his

pleted in 1862, when it was dedicated. In the published record of Cardinal
VViseman’s tour in Ireland, his Eminenoe is reported to have said, in a lecture
delivered in London ι “ The most graeeful parochial church I have seen, during
my tour in Ireland, is St. Mary’s, Athlone.'’ It was Dr. Kilduff promoted it
and blessed it. Dr. (lunen, Archbishop of Dublin, preached the dedication
sermon. Mr. John Bourke was the architect. 1
