BOUNDARIES or ARDAGH DIOCESE. 13

Lynch, in his MSS. History, observes that St. Erard was
Bishop of the Oity of Ratisbon, died in the year 754, and was
buried in a convent of nuns. He adds that this saint performed
several miracles, before and after his death, upon the blind, the
deaf, the lame, and persons suffering from other bodily in-
firmities, and that he was canonized by Pope Leo IX„ and his
festival placed on the eighth of J anuary.

The words of Lynch MSS. are, “Tamen sub annum 754,
Ratisbonae cujus urbis episcopus erat, mortuus, in caenobio
Monialium inhumatus est miraculis ab eo post et ante mortem,
in caecitatis, surditatis, claudicationis et aliarum aegritudinum
sanitate editis, tantam ei sancitatis opinionem conciliantibus, ut
eum Leo IX. in sanctorum numerum retulerit et 8 Januarii
diem ei colendo, assignaverit.'’

The chain of succession is again here broken. Our Annallists
make no mention of a Bishop of Ardagh until 872, when they
record the death of F aelghus Episcopus Ardaghedensis.

The thread of succession is again broken3 for the Annal-
lists have no record of his successor until the year 1048, when
the death of Oeili, Bishop of Ardagh‚ is mentioned.

Here again the chain of succession is broken, for there is no
record of another Bishop of Ardagh until Macreit O’Moran
flourished. He is said to have been Bishop of Kilmore as well as
Ardagh. Bishop O’Moran lived to the advanced age of 83.
He assisted at the Synod of Kesss, held in the year 1152, and in
the catalogue thereos is called Bishop of Oonmacne, i. 6.,
Ardagh. He died in 1168.

To him succeeded Christian O'Hetai O’Heroic‚ in 1172.
Hovenden mentions this prelate under that year. The Annal-
lists record his death at the year 1178.

O’Kirlenan or O'Tirlenan succeeded. He died in 1187. Δ

O'Hislenan succeeded. He died in 1189. It is said he
was slain. The Annallists do not mention the supposed cause
nor the circumstances in which this event took place.

Adam O'Murredai succeeded. He is reckoned among the
benefactors to the Abbey of Tristernagh.

For besides the confirmation of several churches in the
Diocese of Ardagh,¹ he granted to them the tithes of Tyrclogher
and Olomellan‚ Rathowen and Ardglass, saving his episcopal
customs. O'Muredy died in 1217.

To him succeed Robert, whom the Annallists call an English-
man. He was a Cistercian monk, and the eleventh Abbot of
St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin. He granted and confirmed the
tithes to the Abbey of Tristernagh, the Church of Leene, savin g
his episcopal rights, as Richard de la Corne, Bishop of Meath,
also did. The Annals of St. Mary’s Abbey give him the title of
