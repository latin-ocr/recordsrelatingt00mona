CORMAO MAcCOUGHLAN

was appointed by Brief, on the 11th January‚ in 1425. He
had been Dean of the Chapter at Clonmacnoise before his
nomination to this 800. Although appointed at Rome 111
the year already named, it appears he was not consecrated
before 1427. Warev observes, “I do not know how it hap-
pened that his consecration was so long delayed.’' There is
in the Registry of Dr. John Smin, Archbishop of Armagh,
then Administrator of this See during the vacancy, a Com-
mission for Visitation of the Diocese of Olonmacnoise‚ to the
aforesaid Cormac, whom he styles Bishop Elect‚ and to John
O'MayL Abbot of the Monastery of Granard, dated on the
above day and year, whereby 110 constituted them sub-guardians
of the See of Clonmacnoise. There is, moreover, another
citation to him as Bishop Elect‚ recorded in the same Registry‚
whereby he is called on to appear at a Provincial Synod, to be
held at Drogheda the October following3 but he did not appear.
Some writers say he died in 1442 3 but, most probably, the year
-of his death was 1444 ; for it appears in the Annals of Dudley
