the high festival. They are coming, the Saints of Arran-—-
Enda, F innian, and Columba, and with them they lead the
white-robed crowd of religious men, among whom St. Kyran
spent his youth. Coming are the sainted priests and holy
Levites, whom he taught and sanctified in his island home in

hast given her, may be found imperishably united and living in
her love. Amen.

hand, and, apparently, with little to· distinguish it from the-

the day on which it was inaugurated by its founder, Auguste
