061116 10 put a veil upon her head, in order that she should not
come without a veil into the presence of the clerics, and

holding the leg of the altar in her hand, and although four
churches were burned‚ and that leg in them, yet it was not
burned.’' See O'Cccrrgs's MSS. Life, Trcmslattons, p. 28. 29, 30,
