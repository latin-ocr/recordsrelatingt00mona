amount. Let us, therefore, first of all, bring home to our
minds the consideration that the undertaking we are about to
-engage in is by no means impossible of accomplishment, that it
will not even press inconveniently upon any individual, and that
all that is required is a generous effort of the diocese at large.

In thus seeking to obtain your combined co-operation‚ let
me anticipate a difficulty which possibly may stand in the way.
>It may occur to individuals to say: “ The amount I am able to
afford is but a trifle. If 1 give it, it will scarcely add anything
to the general fund. If I withhold it, it will not be missed
from so large an amountf' This mode of reasoning may occur
not only to individuals, but to the population of an entire parish,
which, extending its influence, would mar the general effort to
*a degree it would be difficult to calculate. Instead, then, 01 3
1110ἀο 01 reasoning which would be fatal, let us say, that the
work on hands is not the work 01 the diocese generally, but of
each individual in particular. Let each 0110 01 us say, “ Ι, too—
Ἰ, 111 particular—am called upon to have my share in this work,
to contribute according to my means towards its execution.’'

I am aware that you have already, at different times, been
called upon, and, were I even to be silent, the building‚ in all
the magnitude of its 81Ζο and splendour 01 its style, would
proclaim the generosity of your contributions. But is it not on
this account that it is so dear to yOU, that you have its comple-
tion so much at heart, and that you glory beforehand in the
-everlasting honour it is destined to confer upon the illustrious
prelate by whom it was undertaken, and upon the zealous clergy
..and faithful laity by whom he was aided in forwarding its
⁷ ‚rogress Ρ
l Ι, therefore, flatter myself that, so far from regarding your
past generosity as an obj ection, I am to look to it as an earnest
of the success of the effort now to be made. Wherefore, relying
fully upon your good will—upon the good will of the devoted
›clergy, and the good will of the faithful laity 01 the diocese——
I shall be content with merely placing before your minds the
religious motives by' which you are to be actuated in giving
your contributions.

We read in the Book of Exodus that, when Moses was con-
ducting the Israelites through the desert, he was commanded
by the Almighty to construet a Tabernacle for their religious
worship. The servant 01 God instantly resolved to obey the
command, and called upon all the children of Israel to contri-
