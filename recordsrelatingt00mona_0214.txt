poral rights of princes? I consider that, for a long time, no
Pope had assumed any authority that would infringe upon the
temporal rights of sovereigns.

The question is, what is your conception as to the length of
that time of which you speak in your last answer ; is it half a
century, or one century, or five, or what other length of time Ρ
Grantin g that at any period Popes assumed that power, at least
for several years they have put forth no such pretensions.

We wish to know what is your general impression upon the
subject 3 we do not seek to fix you to any limited time ; do you
conceive that within the last century that right has been assumed Ρ
Being on oath, Ι feel unwilling to mention any precise number
of ears.

yYou have spoken of the Lateran Oouncils„ to which it has
been imputed that they assumed the right of deposing monarchs
under certain circumstances3 do you not conceive that these
decrees, whatever they may have been, expressed the principle
of the Roman Catholic Ohurch at the time the decrees were
made, that is, the principle that in a possible case a Oouncil,
however constituted, might depose a king P I consider that the
Councils referred to, by no means expressed the principle that
any Council had the power from Grod of deposing a king.

Are we misinformed or in error in supposing that in the 27th
capt. of the Third Oouncil of Lateran there is the following
passage :——“ That all those who are ¹in any way bound to heretics
should consider themselves absolved from all allegiance or
obedience due to them as long as they persist in their iniquity Ρ ”
Ι have observed in a former answer that the enactments of that
Council, inasmuch as they regard heretics, are to be considered
as parliamentary decrees emanating from princes 01· temporal
lords, who, in unison with the bishopS, decreed temporal punish-
ments against the Albigenses, the Valdenses, and other heretics‚
who not only erred in matters of religion, but also committed
excessive cruelties on those who rejected their principles. As
the accuracy of this statement can be ascertained by consulting
authentic history, Ι see no reason for concluding that the Oouncil
assumed any right of interfering in tem poralities.

Will you point out what you consider to be an authentic text
of the canon of the Third Lateran Council, also the Fourth
Lateran Council, also the Council of Oonstzmce, to which you
have referred respecting John Huss. The Commissioners have
received from the Library of Maynooth a book entitled “ Binnii
Concilia,” in four very large vols., and they presume that the canons
of those Councils will be found in those vols. ? I understand
that some of the canons referred to are not found in the vols.
just- mentioned.
