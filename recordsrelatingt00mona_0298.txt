Prelate, Most Rev. J. Kilduff.

The news of Dr. McCabe's elevation to the Episcopacy wa s-
received with much joy and satisfaction by the Irish Hierarchy,
and many others who held his character in high respect and.
veneration, as the following letters will show :—

Rome, 3rcl December, 1867.
MY DEAR DR. Momm,—

, Ι have waited till the official information of the nomina*
tion for Ardagh should be sent to Ireland and to yourself, tos
offer you my sincere and heartfelt congratulations on the result.
Το you, personally, the nomination will be a matter of anxiety
and responsibility. But our good God who has so ordained it„
will, through the intercession of our glorious Mother, St. Patrick,
and St. Vincent, give you all the strength and virtutem eze αἶΐο1
to render your administration useful to his divine honour and
the salvation of souls. It will be no small consolation to you
to know that all that you had put forward in your letter to the-
Oardinal Prefect on the subject was taken into mature considera-
tion by the Sacred Congregation, and subsequently by the
Holy Father himself. So that you can happily look upon the·
ultimate decision of His Holiness as that of our divine Lord
himself, calling upon you by the voice of his Vicar upon earth
to submit to this cross for His sake, and for the salvation of the-
souls which He purchased at so dear a rate ; whilst He Himself‘
by His holy grace will lighten its weight on your shoulders„
and smoothen the way before you : Acly‘uvcct certantes qui certamen
indixit. In the meantime, St. Patrick and St. Vincent will look
out for the congregation and the college, so that your obedience·>
to the Vicar of Christ shall not redound to the prejudice of
either. We are all alive and well in Rome, after the latev
dangers we escaped. Our liberation is acknowledged by all t0›
be miraculous, considering the infernal plot which had been
laid for the ruin of the Pope and the city, on the 22nd October,
and the large invading force with which both were assailed from
without, on the following days, till the victory of Mentana,
gained by 3,000 of the Pope’s troops, aided by 2000 F rench,
over an united force of Piedmontese regular troops and
Garibaldians‚ amounting to about double their number, destroyed
the projects of the wicked assailan‘cs, and again restored con--
fidence and security to the city, at least for the present. As to
the future, so visible has been the divine interposition on the>
late occasion in behalf of the city, that it would look like down-
right infidelity to doubt of the same merciful protection for
the future, so all feel that we can say with the Apostle: Ea:-
