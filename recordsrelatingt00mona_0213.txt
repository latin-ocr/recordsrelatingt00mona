MINUTES oF EVIDENCE. 193

The Bulls which it contains must be extremely numerous?
It contains all the authentic Bulls of the several Popes.

Published by the authority of the Holy See ⁴? Ι cannot say
by what authority it is published, but Ι know it exists in the
public libraries of Rome.

The Commissioners then understand that the question about
the Bull “ Unam Sanctam '' stands over for an answer until a
reference shall be had to the text of the Bull itself Ρ Inde-
pendently of a reference to the Bull, and without meaning what
Ι now offer as my ultimate answer and explanation, Ι think that
when he says that both the temporal and spiritual swords are in
the power of the Pope, that he means certainly, first, that the
spiritual sword is so in a direct sense, as the Pope has the power
of expounding the Word of God, and determining matters of
saith and governing the Ohurch ; and that in an indirect manner
also the temporal sword ought to be in the power of St. Peter;
for example, if a sovereign were about to make war, and he had
any qualms of conscience about the war, whether it was just or
not, and if he had thought proper to apply to the Pope, and put
him in full possession of the circumstances that led him to make
that war, if, then, the Pope considered that he had not sufficient
grounds for making war, and that he would commit an act of
injustice in making that war, the Pope would be authorised to
give him an advice not to do it; but that would not be by the
Pope interfering directly in tempora] concernS, it would be
merely acceding to the application that might be made to the
Pope. Though ,Ι do not give that as my answer upon the
subject, even that would be enough to explain the difficulty,
because in such a case the temporal sword would in no degree be
subject to the spiritual one, inasmuch as the advice of the
Church might sway the intentions of any tempora] prince.

Was not the Bull ‘⁶ Unam Sanctam ’' issued‚ not in answer
to any advice sought for by the French king, but in collision
with his interest and against his will Ρ Ι did not mean the
answer I have just given as my ultimate answer, but Ι said that
even that answer might suffice.

Were we to understand you as meaning by a former answer
that you conceive that it is now morally impossible for the
Pope to issue Bulls conflicting in any manner with the temporal
rights of princes Ρ Ι consider that in the present state of things
the Popes will not knowingly issue any Bulls to infringe on the

temporal rights· of princes.

Since that period do you consider that that change, if it be a
change, in the practice of the Popes has arisen3 the question
assumes that a time has existed in which Popes did feel at
liberty knowingly to issue Bulls that did conflict with ‘the tem-
