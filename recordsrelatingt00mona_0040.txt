20 mocnsn OF ARDAGH.

and were alike eldest sons, born to hereditary estates and wealth.
They were, moreover, alike in that they were masters in Sacred
Theology and famed as preachers of the truths of religion.
They had held honourable posts in the convents of the Order at
Longford, Roscommon, Derry‚ and elsewhere, and throughout
the whole period of the Consederate War had proved themselves
staunch champions of the Faith. Alike revered by the clergy
and people, their names had been presented as most worthy to
be promoted to the episcopal rank, and, in common with their
devoted sept, they resolved either to preserve intact and incor-
rupt the Faith handed down to them for twelve hundred years,
or to die gloriously in its defenoe. Animated with such senti-
ments, when arrested in the habit of the Order, they could not
be induced by threats or promises to embrace the tenets of
heresy. WVherefore they were cruelly treated as defenders of
Popery, spies of the Roman Pontiff, enemies of the Protestant
Church, and the heretics shouted out, ‘ Away with these cham-
pions and leaders of the Papists3 kill them, hang them.’ Father
Bernard, struck with swords and spears, was on the spot pierced
with eighteen mortal wounds, and was left for dead, being
almost suffocated by his own blood. Life remained, however,
till the last Sacraments were administered to him, and then the
crown of martyrdom was added to that of the doctorate, which,
a little while before, had been deservedly awarded him by
Father Marinus, the General of the Dominican Order. Father
Laurence O'Ferall was made prisoner without receiving any
wounds, and being thrown into prison. he was ordered to be
hanged on the following Wednesday. Led to the scaffold, he
displayed the greatest courage and joy3 but, at the request of
some English noblemen and others, who came to the unwonted
spectacle, a respite till the following Saturday was granted.
When this announcement was made to him, nothing could
exceed his grief, to the astonishment of all who were present3
and when they asked why he thus sorrowed, he replied, because
I feel myself at present so well disposed to meet death for Grod
and for the Catholic Faith, that I fear Ι never again may be
equally prepared for so happy a death. In the meantime,
several English Protestants petitioned and made great efforts
to have his life spared. All was in vain. On the following
Saturday he was led to the scaffold. From the steps he ad-
dressed a most earnest exhortation to those present, so moving,
that all shed tears, and some were converted to the Faith. His

discourse being ended, he was hanged, and thus attained the
martyr's crown.’'
