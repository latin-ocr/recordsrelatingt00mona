οη. KILDUFF. 223

7because he still experienced that violent jarring and repugnance
of his sensitive appetite to reason, of the flesh to the spirit, of
corrupt nature to grace, which had placed him under the neces-
sity of constantly mortifying himself, in order thereby to subdue
his passions, and keep them in subjection and obedience. ‘⁵ For
I am delighted‚'’ he says, “ with the law of God, according to
the inward man: but I see another law in my members‚ fighting
against the law of my mind, and captivating me in the law
of sin, that is in my memberS.'’—Rom. vii. 22, 23. ⁴
And we, my brethren, who have to contend with the samo
enemies, we whose daily faults and transgressions are multiplied
beyond number, shall we be still insensible to the necessity of
mortification ⁶? Oh, it is time to shake off this fatal lethargy;
“ for as you have yielded your members, to serve uncleanness,
and iniquity unto iniquity,'' so now I conjure you, with the
Apostle‚ “ to yield your members to serve justice, unto sanctifi-
cationst—Rom. vi. 19. We are all of us sinners, and, as such,
we have contracted the obligation of leading truly mortified and
penitential lives. The faithful, in the primitive ages of the
Church, were so fully convinced of the indispensable necessity
of doing penance to repair their past transgressions, that, as we
read in ecclesiastical history, they retired in crowds to the desert,
resolved to pass their days in the constant practice of sels-deniaL
fasting, and the like acts of mortification. For a single mortal
sin committed after baptism, they subjected themselves to a
weekly fast on bread and water for the space of three, seven,
ten, and fifteen years. And can we pretend that our lives are
more regular than were the lives of the primitive Christians Ρ
’Ῑε not the justice of Grod still unchangeably the same ⁴? Are
works of mortification and penance less necessary in the present
age than in the early ages of the Ohurch Ρ Alas 1 we are per-
suaded that we have many ways offended God, and that, if our
sins be not remitted, we shall be eternally lost. In the mean-
time, we know not if our Sovereign Judge be yet appeased3 we
know not whether, in the language of Scripture, ‘⁵ we be worthy
of love or hatred.''—Eccles. We are uncertain of the efficacy
of our past repentance 3 and, consequently, we are uncertain
whether we be in the state of grace or in the state of reproba-
tion. Should not these refiections frequently alarm us Ρ Should
they not excite us to, the continual practice of mortification all
the days of our life. Moreover, dearest brethren, you should
always bear in mind that, even if you depart this life in the
grace and friendship of God, but without having, by your
voluntary mortifications and acts of sels-denial, discharged the
full amount of debt you owe to the justice of God, without
‘shaving made due reparation for the injury you have committed
