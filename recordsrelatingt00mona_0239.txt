DR. KILDUFF. 219*

by speaking 01 1110 little Chapel 01 Longioffl, which, in itsv
present condition, is all but a complete wreck. Let us rather
look forward with pleasing anticipation to the splendid building
destined 101· our new Cathedral. Let us consider how ther
Almighty looks down upon it from on high; how He would
call upon us all and each to expedite the completion 01 11118
magnificent structure3 and how He is ready to associate us
with the merit 01 all the prayers and sacrifices and other acts
01 religion which shall be perpetually performed therein.

Thus convinced that the work before us is the work 01 (10(1-ν
that it is 101· Grod and His holy worship that we are building a
suitable abode—there is not, I am sure, a single individual
thloughout the length and hreadth 01 this extensive diocese
that will not contribute according to his s.means Ι even flatter
111578οΙ1 with the conviction that a spirit 01 emulation will spread
over the entire population, that parish will rival parish, and
that individual will outvie individual in generosity.

I should wish it were in my power to appear amongst you·
personally in your respective parishes, in order to enjoy the
gratification 01 receiving from you immediately this tribute,
and 01 expressing to you in person my gratitude on behalf 01
religion. As this, however, will be impossible, consistently
with the other heavy and important duties I have to attend to,
I must 110 content to confide this duty to the clergy 111 111011·
respective localities, confidently relying as well on their zeal as
on the ready correspondence 01 1110 faithful. Besides, it is my
desire that the collection would be simultaneous throughout the
entire diocese, and I have made an arrangement with the clergy
that Sunday‚ the 27th inst, shall be the day set apart 101· 1110
pur ose.

Ι111 conclusion, let me exhort you to join with me in praying·
earnestly that the Almighty Giver 01 all good gifts may bestow
His blessing upon our efforts ; that Mary, the immaculate
Mother 01 God, may aid us by her powerful intercession3 and
that our diocesan patron, St. Mel, may grant us the advocacy
01 1118 prayers. And, 101· ourselves, let us recollect that God
doth love the generous giver, and that He has promised a
hundred-sold reward, even in this world, for every sacrifice we·
make in His name, and that, by erecting a temple to His wor-
ship on this earth, we are establishing 101· ourselves a claim to
be admitted into the everlasting tabernacles 01 heaven.

The grace 01 our Lord J esus s‘hrist, and the charity 01 God,
and the communication 01 the Holy Ghost be with you all

Amen.
