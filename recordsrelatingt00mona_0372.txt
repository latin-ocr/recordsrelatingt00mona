It was thus Olonmacnoise obtained the ownership of that
place, a spot afterwards celebrated through its connection with
him who established thereon a monastery. The personal fame
and greatness of its founder and patron was the occasion of
acquiring for it a new name—viz„ Liath Manchan—a name by
which not alone the group of monastic ruins, but the entire·
parish, is called and known, even to this day.

The founder and patron of this old monastic establishment
was Manchan* Considerable uncertainty, however, surrounds-
his identification, for there were several saints of that name. In
the Irish calendars records are to be found of twelve distinct
festivals, set apart to honour saints called Manchan. Just as⁴
there have been many saints called Ronan and Lasera, so, too,
there have been several Manchans. Of these, the most cele--
brated seem to have been Manchan, Abbot and Bishop of Tom-
graney, Oo. Clare3 Manchan, of Dysart GaHen, Queen's Co„
who was called the wisa Irishman. The remains of his church
and monastery are still to be seen in a sequestered and romantic
valley, surrounded by scenery of a character charmingly pictur-
esque and lovely. His virtues are recorded in the Book de
Marabilz'bus Scripturae. But Manchan, of Liath Manchan, seems
to have been the greatest of them all. Ware states that amongst
the alleged works of Richard Fitzralph, Archbishop of Armagh,
was a Vita Sancti Manchani.

It is even said that Ussher had it in his hand, but Dr.
Todd and others searched for it in Ussher’s Library and failed?
to find it. Some say it is in the Bodleian Library, Oxsord. If
so, 1 hope yet to read it. Meanwhile, I shall set down now*
what appears to be certain from present available sources re·
garding Manchan of Lemanaghan.

The Annals of Clonmacnoise state “ it was erroneously
affirmed that Manchan was a Welshman, and came to this coun-·
try with St. Patrick.'' It seems good, therefore, to here set
down his pedigree to disprove their allegations. Manchan was
the son of Failve, who was the son of Augine, who was son of
Bogany, who was son of Connell Galbam, the aneestors of
O'Donnell, as is confidently laid down among the genealogies of
the saints of Ireland. It seems, moreover, certain that he was⁴
a very learned man, at least in the Scriptures, for he was called
the J erome of Ireland, being “very like unto him in habits of
life and learning.''

Besides, he was a poet of a very high order, having com-
posed that charming poem :—

“ Would that, O Son of the living God!
Ο eternal, ancient King !’' δια, &c.

’ Petrie, O'Donovan, and others, uuanimously state that Monahan is the—
English name of Manchan.
