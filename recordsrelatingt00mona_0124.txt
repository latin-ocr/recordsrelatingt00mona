3. Decrees of the Bishops‚ Sto„ assembled at Olonmaonoise,
13th December, 1649.

(From the Wadding Papers, Rome.)

We, the Archbishops‚ Bishops, and other ordinaries and
Prelates of the kingdom of Ireland, having met at Clonmac-
noise‚ proprio motu, the 4th day of December, in the year, 1649,
to consider the best means to unite our fiocks for averting God’s
wrath fallen on this nation, now bleeding under the evils that
famine, plague, and war, bring after them, for effecting a pre-
sent union, decreed the ensuing acts :—

1. We order and decree as an act of this congregation that all
Archbishops‚ Bishops, and other Ordinaries within their re-
spective dioceses, shall enjoin public prayers, fasting‚ general
confessions‚ and receiving, and other works of piety, toties
quoties, to withdraw from this nation God’s anger, and to render
them capable of his mercies.

2. We order and decree as an act of this congregation that
a Declaration be issued from us, letting the people know how
vain it is for them to expect from the common enemy, com-

any assurance of their religion, lives, or fortunes.

same, and as the chief means to preserve the nation against the
extirpation and destruction of their religion and fortunes re-
solved on by the enemy. And we hereby do manifest our
detestation against all such divisions between either provinces
or families, or between old English and old Irish, or any of the
English or Scots adhering to his Majesty, and we do dccree and
order that all ecclesiastical persons fomenting such dissensions
or unnatural divisions be punished by their respective prelates
and superiors, juxta fflavitaz‘em excessus eb (si opus fuerit) sus—
pendantur beneficiali et Prasiores a beneficio et officio ad certum
tempus, relz'ffl'osz' autem α divinis juxta circumstantias delicti, leaving
the laity, offending in this kind, to be corrected by the civil
magistrate, by imprisonment, fine, banishment‚ or otherwise, as
to them shall seem best, for plucking by the roots so odious a
crime, the execution whereof we most earnestly recommend to
all those having power, and that all are concerned therein as

they will answer to God for the evils that thereout may
ensue.

4. We decree and declare excommunicated those highway
