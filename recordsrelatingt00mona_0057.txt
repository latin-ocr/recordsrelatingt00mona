Vic. Aplicus, Ardaghaden.

In 1688 Gregory Fallon was appointed Bishop of 0101111166-
noise, and Administrator of Ardagh. From 1696 to 1709 this
See was again under Vicars. Chas. Tiernan was appointed Vic.
Apostolic on the 4th June, 1696.

Bernard Donogher was proposed, on the 4th of May, 1699,
as Vicar Apostolic, to succeed Tiernan, who had died. Donogher
was appointed on the 27th of July, and his Brief was dated
August 20, 1699. Η6 continued Vicar Apostolic until 1709.

1709. Ambrose O’Oonor succeeded. He was recommended
to the united Sees of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise by letter of
James II„ dated 16th of June, 1709, from St. Germains.
O'Connor was of noble birth, about fifty-five years old, and of
robust constitution for endurance of hardships. He was Master in
Theology and Provincial of the Dominicans. He was in Paris,
1709 (Propaganda Archives). O'Oonor died in London, Feb.
20, 1711, before consecration. (Hib. Dom.)

Dr. O'Oonor was an alumnus of the Sligo Dominican College,
and for thirty years acted as Proctor at Madrid for the Irish
Dominicans. In 1700 116 became Prior Provincial, and was
continued in that office until 1708. 1711. Thomas Moran,
Guardian of S. Isodore's‚ Rome, was proposed for the See of
Arda h.

1318. Thomas Flynn succeeded. He was appointed by
Bries, dated May 18, 1718. In J uly, 1718, 116 received a Brief
empowering him to receive consecration from one bishop, with
two dignitaries assisting. Dr. Flynn appears as a bishop in 1730.

In those pena-l times, Dr. O’Flynn was compelled to
administer the Sacrament of Confirmation under very distressing
circumstances, sometimes at night. On one occasion he selected
the townland of Drumgilra, in the parish of Gortliteragh‚
because it was inaccessible to the Eritish troops, being surrounded
by bogs and rivers. It is said his remains were interred in
Cloone, Co„ Leitrim. During his Episcopacy, Clonmacnoise was
finally united to Ardagh, and has been continuously held with it
since. - As the succession in both dioceses is, from 1729, to be
found in the same person, it is fitting that I should now turn to
the origin of the See of Clonmacnoise, and endeavour to trace the
succession of its bishops down to its union with the more ancient
