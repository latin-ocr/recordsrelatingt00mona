CLONMACNOISE, ΟΒ, THE SEVEN CHURCHES. 71

octogenarian of wonderful physique. In the course of a long
conversation with him, I found he knew nearly all the Irish
celebrities of the century. He had, in fact, been the entertainer
«of them all. No one came to see Clonmacnoise without calling
to see himself. And it was with much interest I watched the
venerable old man, as, with the enthusiasm of second youth, he
would point me out the table where rollicking Sam Lover took
many keenly-relished repasts, and cracked many a characteristic
j oke. Here was the chair often occupied by no less apersonage
‘than our great antiquarian Petrie, of round-tower fame, who,
:after “ doing ’' the vicinity, would invariably pay his devoirs to
Mr. Molloy, and chat with him on the Firbolgs and the Tuatha
De Danaans. There was the stool on which sat Sir Samuel
Ferguson, the most Celtic poet modern Ireland has produced3
while scattered through kitchen and parlours‚ the eyes fell on
articles of furniture, &c., associated with some such other men
and their memories, the majority of Mr. Molloy’s guests having
been poets, orators, statesmen, statisticians or titled folk3 the
vulqus profanum having generally shared as little in his board as
it did in his estimation. And yet no blue blood coursed through
the veins of Mr. Molloy himself. He was one of the masses,
but belonged to that portion of the masses which directly de-

:and held opinions to suit his business. Withal nature's real old
gentleman was F armer Molloy. His life must have been a
‘'blameless and happy one3 for when I saw him, although he had
‘then weathered the storms of eighty-three winters, Time appeared
to have dealt lightly with him, and he bore his years with a
Herculean strength. To his hale and hearty constitution he
*added a sprightly Celtic character; and his conversation had
peculiar charms, from a sort of subdued humour, which gave zest
‘without acidity to whatever he said. His wife, who was some
‘twenty years younger than he, was a fitting helpmate to the
worthy man, and her manners and information appeared to me
to have been above the common level. Three branches had
sprung from the parent stock, two damsels and a stalwart youth.
One of the maidens was a type of Irish beauty‚ with her raven
hair fringing an elaborate brow, her dark Byronic eyes flashing
fire and humour, her rosebud lips, and that delicate flush purplin g
‘her smooth cheeks——the ensemble giving evidence not alone of
..artistic perfection, but that coy archness for which, I believe,
Irish peasant girls alone are matchless among their sex. Take
the family all in all, I fear it will be long before I look upon
their like again; and Sir Samuel Ferguson, at present Deputy
Keeper of the Rolls in Dublin, will bear me out when I say that
its members are as good a specimen as possible of the race whose
