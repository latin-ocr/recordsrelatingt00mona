mi ght use such a document against Lord Mulgrave’s Govern
ment, by putting it forth as an evidence that, so far from
being tranquil, Ireland was, on our own showing, universally

dletssgicivill best understand what Ι have been able to do on

the Belgian question, by looking to the ‘⁶ Resolution,'’ which
you will find on the opposite page. The sum to which that
resolution refers amounts to about four thousand flames. As to
the removal of the funds from Belgium to Rome, such a mea-
sure was deemed impracticable 3 and, though it could be affected,
the bishops most interested seemed unwilling that it should be
carried. Ι assure you very sincerely that, in procuring for the
use of your college the 4‚000 francs just mentioned, I felt it
necessary to exert very strenuously whatever little powers I
could command. I must, however, say, in justice to the bishopS,
they unanimously concurred in the warmest approval—indeed,
Ι may say—admiration of your conduct, and a resolution to
that effect was proposed and carried.

Dr. Smith was consecrated in Trinidad, by Dr. MacDonnell,
assisted by two priests. He comes here to his native diocese
in May, and proposes staying nearly a year in Ireland. When
he arrives, Ι shall not fail to give him some useful advice in
the sense you have suggested. Now that Dr. Oarew is ap-

ointed to Madras, our friend, Mr. O'Reilly, has no excuse.
Vill he come, &Q &Q &a . . .
With best good wishes for Messrs. Kirby and O’Reilly,

Ι remain, my dear Dr. Cullen,
Ever sincerely and affectionately yourS,

Very Rev, Dr. Oullen.

Internuncio in Belgium, enabling his Excellency to receive the
sums now in the hands of the Receiver-General to the funds
of the old Irish College in Faurnai ; and that his Excellency be
prayed to transmit further the said sumto the Rector of the
Irish College at Rome, for the general use of that establish—
