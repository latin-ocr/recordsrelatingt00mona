356 , DIOCESE oF ARDAGH.

In England, nearly all the shrines were broken and plundered.
at the time of the Reformation.

That of Edward the Confessor‚ I have been told, is the only
one remaining, and is preserved at Westminster Abbey.

The shrine of St. Werburgh was in tolerably good preserva»
tion up to about ten years ago, at Chester ; of which she is the*
Virgin Patroness.

It was until quite recently a beautiful and lofty stone remain.

The colours on her tomb were pleasing and striking. It was-
used up to about ten years ago as a throne for the Protestant
Bishop, who, finding it inconveniently high for that purpose„
had it removed and replaced ⁴ by the present elegant Gothic·
throne, to hold the prelate and his two chaplains. Alas, the
saint's once beautiful tomb lies now a mass of broken ruins,
strewn on the floor of the south aisle of the choir, where they
can be seen through the railings of the aisle at the entrance·
under the tower.

In Ireland, the destruction was not so complete, owing tor
the tenacity with which its ever faithful Catholics clung to-
their faith. Its shrines, reliques, and consecrated obj ects they
guarded as the apple of their eye. It is honourable to our
national character to have preserved, in spite of the strongest
temptations‚ with such becoming fidelity, these sacred deposits,
and over so many generations after they had lost their other
possessions. But to return to the shrine of St. Manchan. It is
preserved in the Chapel of Boher, near to the Prospect Statim,
on the Great Southern and Western Railway to Athlone. It
was formerly kept in a small thatched building used as a chapel
in the penal times. Local traditions state that the chapel
was burned, but the shrine was miraculously saved from the fire.

It was afterwards cared by Mr. Mooney‚ of Doon, who finally
placed it in the hands of its natural and best guardian and pro--
tector, the Parish Priest for the time being, where it now rests.

Like Colomba’s shrine, it has travelled much, but under
different circumstances and from different causes. ·It was at
at two of the qreat Eoelzibz‘tions in Dublin. It was at one of the
great London Eoelaibitimz& and it was at one of the great Exhibi-
tions of Paris, held during the reign of N apoleon III„ who
sent a yold medal to the then Bishop of Ardagh, Dr. Kilduff, of
haippy memory‚ in consideration for the loan of so valuable a
re c.

In the lapse of time it lost some of its original orna--
ments, but a fair idea of what it was in its perfect state may be

gathered from the fac-simile (No. 1857) by Dr. Carte, to be·
seen in the Gold Room of the Royal Irish Academy. In this.
fac-simile the deficient parts have been restored from those
