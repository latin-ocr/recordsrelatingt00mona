APPENDIX. 389

‘Branch of the N ational League, presented an Address to
Mr. J. P. O’Byrne‚ who appropriately responded to same,

On the motion of Mr. Thomas Byrne, seconded by Mr.
Peter Keogh, the chair was taken, amidst loud applause, by
the Rev. Canon MONAHAN,

The Rev. Canon Monahan said :—Mr. President of the His-
torical and Antiquarian Society of Ireland and gentlemen, I
thank you, in the first place, for the distinguished honour you
have conferred on me by asking me to preside as chairman on
this interesting and important occasion3 and, in the second
place, Ι desire, on the part of the many visitors here assembled
from the barony of Garrycastle and its neighbourhood, and on
my own part also, to tender to you, the members of the Histo-
rical Society, our most cordial greetings. The main object of
your visit to these ruins is to promote the study and cultivation
of the ancient history and literature os our dear native land, its
records and its monuments. By worthily and efficaciously
doing so, you yourselves are, doubtless‚ making contemporaneous
history. Right fittingly‚ then, have you chosen Glonmacnoise
as the place for this day's pilgrimage ; for I can affirm, without

object of the deepest interest. For what is Conmacnoise ⁴? It
is an entombed city, of greater and more deserving fame, in
some respects, than Pompeii or Baiiae—-cities buried more than
1800 years ago by an eruption from Mount Vesuvius, near
N aples—cities which all European travellers feel bound to go
and see in their present excavated condition. What is Olon-
macnoise P It is the remains of ruined temples, fallen thrones,
and broken sceptresf (applause). Look around and what do you
behold P The ruins of a cathedral, eight or nine churcheS, and
<an hospital raised by the munificence of kingsand chieftains—
nay more, in some instances, by the hands of the kings and
-chieftains themselves, who personally assisted the tradesmen in
their erection. Look away down before you and what do you
behold ‚9 The remains of the church of the nunnery‚ built or
‘repaired, in 1167, by Devorgilla, the unfaithful wife of Tiernan
«O’Rourke—a lady who was the immediate occasion of the pos·
