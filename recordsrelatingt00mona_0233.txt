Da. KILDUFF. 213

To preach the gospel to every creature was the commission
,given to the Apostles. Partaking 01 111011 ministry and con-
tinuing the same heavenly dispensation, we have taken upon
rourselves the same high and holy duty. In virtue 01 1110 10-
sponsibih'ty attached to our ordination, we must say with the
.Apostle: “ 11 Ι preach the gospel‚ it is no glory to me: 101 0 ’
necessity lieth upon me: Fon WOE 1s UNTO ME 112 1 PREACH
NOT THE GosPEL.''—l Cor. ix. 16. It is under the thrilling
vsense 01 11110 obligation that he exhorts his disciple, Timothy,
and adjures him by the most solemn entreaties saying: “ I
charge thee before (3106. and J esus Christ, who shall judge the
living and the dead, by His coming, and His Kingdom z preach
the WVord: be instant in season, out 01 season: repmve,
enm-eat, rebuke‚'' &0—52 Tim. iv. 1-2.

To DEFEND mmm—As good pastors we have to defend the
1016 01 Christ 110111 1110 111101 and the robber who come not but
“ to steal, and to kill, and to destroy.’'—-J obn, x. 10. “ We must
not be as the hireling, who seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the
sheep, and flieth.’'—John, x. 12. Alas, 11 1110 complaint could
be renewed against us : ‘⁴ My fiook you did not 10οᾶ ; 1110 weak
you have not strengthened, and that which was sick you have
anot healed : that which was broken you have not bound up, and
that which was driven away you have not brought again, neither
have you sought that which was lost. My sheep were scattered,
and they became the prey 01 011 1110 beasts 01 1110 field.''—
Ezech. xxxiv. 3-5. What a dreadful retribution should await
us in the execution 01 1110 sentence already threatened by the
Prophet, in continuation 01 1110 passage just quoted: “ 1 will
require my flock at their hand.'’ In reflecting upon this ob-
ligation 01 our sacred calling, we cannot 101801 1110 times in
which we live. Do they not, in truth, appear to be those
“ dangerous times,” 10101016 by the Apostle.—2 Tim. iii. 1.
We behold the flook invaded by the wolf, at one time, in the
-clothing 01 sheep, and at another in his undisguised ferocity.
Reflecting upon the rage and fanaticism that 01 1010 1100 sprung·

-our times and had sent 101111 0 vapour to poison the very atmo-
sphere 01 000101 1110,,0116. overthrow that charity which teaches
us to love our very enemies, and pray 101· 111000 who persecute
and calumniate us. What vigilance, therefore, and fortitude
do we not need to guard and defend the fiock 01 Christ? Surely
there never was a time when the pastor had more need to keep
’1101010 1110 mind the divine maxim ε “ The good shepherd giveth
his 1110 101 1110 sheep.’'—John‚ x. ii.

And you, dearly beloved Brethren 01 1110 laity‚ is it not on
