morem Scoticarum gentium3 eo quod macerias 80011 11011 0010111
facere 1100 130130 habere.'' Even the learned Dr. Lanigan, so
anxious to uphold the fame 01 ancient Ireland, wrote the
following words 2—“Prior to those 01 1110 twelfth century, we
find very few monuments 01 00010013011031 architecture in Ire-
land. This is not to be wondered at, because the general fashion
of the country was to erect their buildings of wood, a fashion
which in great part continues to this day in several parts of
Europe, and, consequently, as their churches also were usually
built of wood, it cannot be expected that there should be any
remains of such churches at present.’' Such being the opinion
of the learned and laborious Dr. Lanigan, it 0311 scarcely be
wondered at that the English and Scottish writers on architec-
tural ecclesiastical antiquities should have laid it down as a
fact that the Irish were unacquainted with the art 01 building
with lime and stone previously to the Anglo-Norman invasion.
They furthermore have asserted that the Irish monks who settled
in Iona, in the sixth century, were wholly unacquainted with
buildings in stone and mortar. Thus Pinkerton, vol. ii., p. 141,
writes :—“ Ancient monuments 01 1110 British 8001011 there are
none, save cairns 01 0101100 used as sepulchres and as memorials.
These were adapted to Celtic indolence, while the Gothic in-
dustry raised vast stenes instead of piling small ones; 1101 310
any cairns found in Gothic countries, so 131 30 I can leam,
except such as are very large. The Celtic churches, 1103000, &c.,
were all 01 wattles, 30 are the barns at this day in the Hebrides,
00 11131 110 131110 0311 110 found 01 1110111. The early cathedral of
Iona must have been of this sort, and it was burned by the
Danes in the ninth century. The present ruin is not older than
the thirteenth century. In the twelfth century, 81. Bernard
represents a stone church as quite a novelty even in Ireland.'’

To this formidable phalanx 01 writers against stone churches
in Ireland before the thirteenth century, Dr. Petrie opposes
himself, supported, as many think, by most able and conclusive
arguments. Before 1 attempt to produce any of them, it may
be well to observe that he admits the 800110 mode 01 building
with wood prevailed generally in Ireland up to the twelfth or
thirteenth century 111 respect to a particular class 01 buildings,
i.e., monastic houses and oratories.

In the next place, I have to observe that the learned Doctor

no, but 01 010110, 31 least in the churches connected with bishop-
