In the following month of the same year, he addressed a
letter to the clergy, announcing the abolition of Saturday's
abstinence throughout the entire country, and some of the
reasons which led. the Pope to grant such powers to the Irish
prelates. He concluded the letter by the following words :—
“ I have now to call the undivided attention of your pious flock
to a subject that concerns them in a most especial manner, it is
one that cannot but interest every sincere Catholic among them.
I allude to the college we are about to establish for the educa-
tion of the youth of this diocese. It is an undertaking of no
ordinary difficulty. It is the first attempt of the kind made in
Ardagh since the so-called Reformation.” Various circumstances,
however, prevented the success of this project. A classical school
was soon after established at Ballymahon, under the immediate
