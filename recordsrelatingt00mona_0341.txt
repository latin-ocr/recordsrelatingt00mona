RIGHT REV. BERNARD O’REILLY, D.D.

SEcom) Brsnor oF HARTFORD, us.

This distinguished prelate was born in the Townland of Cun-
nareen, Parish of Oolombkille, Oounty of Longford‚ Ireland, in
1803, of a family which had been remarkable during many
years for their love of religion and fatherland. In his youth
he was noted for his humil ity and dignified character, and
gave early proofs of scholarly abilities. Having conceived a
desire to educate himself for the priesthood‚ he gained his
parents' approval, and in furtherance of this design he came to
America on the l7th of J anuary, 1825. Upon his arrival he
jproceeded to Montreal, Canada East, and there continued his
studies. He afterwards went to St. Mary’s Seminary, Baltimore‚
where he was ordained on the l3th of October, 1831, by Right
Rev. Bishop Kenrick‚ of Philadelphia. His first missionary
labours were located in the cities of N ew York and Brooklyn,
in the latter of which he said Mass once every month. His
zeal and charity were unbounded, and manifested their noble
-qualities in the terrible season of the cholera. By day and night
Father O’Reilly laboured in behalf of the plague-stricken ones,
and although twice attacked himself he applied himself anew to
the task as soon as he was able.

In December, 1832, he was appointed to the charge of St.
Patrick's Church. in Rochester. This mission was, at the
time, a very extensive and arduous one. In fact, with one other
priest, Father ‘O'Reilly attended to the whole region which after-
wards became the Diocese of Buffalo. Here for many years he
laboured in this earnest‚ effective manner, until October, 1847,
when Bishop Timon taking possession of the new diocese, he

new seminary and the hospital under the charge of the Sisters
of Charity, the latter of which institutions he ably defended in
public discussions against the jealous attacks of the Protestants.

In May, 1849, Very Rev. F ather O’Reilly was named
Bishop of Hartford, as successor to Bishop Tyler. Owing to
the delays in Rome, occasioned by the revolution and exile of
the Pope, the letters of appointment did not reach him until the
following year. He was consecrated in the former Church of St.
Patrick‚ at Rochester‚ among the people he loved so well, and

:for whose salvation he had laboured so zealously. Im12n20diately
