We cannot subscribe to this position, as experience has con-
vinced us of the fatal impressions made on youth, in all times
and placeS, particularly in France‚ by infidel, seditious‚ or im-
moral professors, even of Grammar‚ and proved the necessity of
scrupulous attention to the principles and conduct of every
teacher‚ previous to his admission into any seminary or school.
It is always more advisable to prevent evil in this manner, than
punish the whisperers of Atheism and J acobinism, by a con-
trolling power in the Bishops to expel them3 moreover‚ the
exercise of this control will appear odious to many, must occa-
sion clamour, and would frequently excite disputes between
the Bishops and lay friends of those unworthy professors or

’ lecturers.

These observations, as you will perceive, are grounded on a
supposition that the intended colleges are to be regulated on
the precise plan presented to your consideration. We extended
it to qeneral instruction, on the suggestion of our zealous and
patriot agent at London, who constantly assured us that it
was the earnest wish of the Duke of Portland‚ Earl Fitzwilliam,
Mr. Burke, and others, that the laity should not be excluded
from the benefit of public instruction in the proposed colleges.

It appears from our printed Memorial to Lord Westmore-

the Sacred Ministry on another proper plan, to be hereafter
-concerted.

As four hundred clerical students are absolutely necessary to
preserve the succession of the Roman Catholic clergy in this
kingdom, we have, after very mature deliberation, judged it
expedient to establish one house in each province for their
education. It is needless now to enter into a detail of our
motives. They are many and weighty. We shall mention
one t—By our having a college in each province, the opulent and
religious Catholics will be more strongly excited to grant dona-
tions to an establishment in their own neighbourhood, than they
would be to others 'at a great distance, which many of them
may view with jealousy, and feel hurt at not being equally
accommodated. '

We confidently hope that these four colleges will equally
pax-take of the N ational bounty in whatever sum it may be

granted by Parliament.
It never was our wish or intention that you should introduce
