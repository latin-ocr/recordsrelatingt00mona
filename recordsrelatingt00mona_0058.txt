OLONMAONOISE ΟΒ, ΤΗΕ SEVEN OHUROHES.

“Majorum igloria‚ poste rnu 1191111911 981.”

About midway between Athlone and Banaghe1,on an ele-
191911 spot gently sloping up 1'1 om 0111 noblest riv er the Shannon,
as it flow 8 noiselesslx and solemnly on, may be seen the
remains of 111 Abbey 11191 01199 119111 high place amongst the
most celebrated centres of sanctity, wisdom, and learning, in
ancient Ireland. During the brightest epo ,h of our real glory,
it ranked second to no rival. Bangor, Clonard‚ and Clonfert‚
alone amongst the multitude of ecclesiastical fortresses that kept
and spread blessed and civilising infiuenoes in our land, were
deemed worthy to be reckoned amongst its competitors. They
did not, however, excel ,11 substantially in aught. Remarkable
alike for the splendour 91111 magnificence of its buildings, the
extent and value of its possessions, the sanctity of its inmates,
the scholar-ly and brilliant attainments of its professors, together
with hospitality to the stranger and the poor, it gradually became
the Iona of Ireland. Need I say more to indicate its name ?
It is a hallowed name, and there 18 9 great deal sometimes in a
name, notwithstanding the insinuation from a high authority to
the contrarv.

Olonmacnoise, or the “ Seven Churches‚³' as it is popularly,
but erroneously called, is the sacred ruin to which Ι refer. Alas,
its greatness has departed. Ruthlessly and violently was it
taken away, and so this venerable Abbey has fallen a victim to
the rapacity of the invader. Sanctity, learning, and hospitality
have fied. The halls and cloisters in which they 8ὀ long
flourished and held sway have long since disappeared, leaving
nothing behind, save mouldering ruins and ivy—clad walls,
sentinelled by two round towers of “ other days,’' to speak the
sad record of 110191911 justice, profaned sanctuary, and fallen
