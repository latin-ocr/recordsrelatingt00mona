have exercised his functions there with zeal, charit-y, and effect ;.
for up to this time, after a separation of many years, and
notwithstanding the great change that took place in his for-
tunes, the name “ Abbe Smith” is still fondly retained and
repeated, with affection and respect, by the inhabitants of San.
F ernando. He was called to the Pastorship of Port of Spain in
1834, and was consecrated Bishop of Agna, by the late Right-
Rev. Dr. McDonnell, on the lOth December, 1837, and for

succeeded to the title of Bishoppopf Olympus, and Vicar Apostolic-
of the British and Danish West India Islands. This office was-
fulfilled with so much zeal and success, and with such satisfaction
to the See of Rome, that, by a special commission‚ he was, on.
the 9th of February, 1851, solemnly installed Archbishop of'
Port of Spain: his Archbishopric including Trinidad, Tobag0,.
Greneda, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent. The illuminations‚ still

Such is a brief outline of the career of the Most Rev.
Richard Patrick Smith. Like all persons who have been con--
spicuous on the stage of life, he could not fail to raise a,
difference of opinion respecting his merits. But facts speak
for themselves. How militating may be, in a certain degree,
the opinion of some, none can justly deny the extraor--

of twenty-four years, without any other resource but self‚.
raised an humble Priest from the poor station of a young-
Missionary to the unprecedented dignity of Archbishop in the-
West Indies. And the admiration must be greater, if we-
reflect that such a result was not achieved through the artillery

standing, and spontaneously proclaims a triumphant general
Emperor ; that it was not obtained in the din of political debates-
when the eloquence of an orator maddens an audience3 but
that it was the work of cool and undaunted perseverance‚ off
tempered talent and energy, and of diplomatic and steady quali-

nature, but an extraordinary command over those passions too·
often created by obstacles and unexpected opposition. Again
