and the Church, no matter what name they may assume, so far
from effecting any good, are always, wherever they exist, most
destructive of every virtue, most injurious to morals, and most
dangerous to the peace of society at large. You will denounce
the wicked promoters of these most mischievous societies as the
greatest enemies of their religion and country—disgracin g the
former as far as man can do, and retarding the progress of the
latter in all useful improvements. Through the bowels of the
mercy of J esus Christ, we exhort and conjure them to open their
eyes to their perilous condition, to the wide-spread scandal they
are giving, and to seek a reconcih‘ation with their God during
this acceptable time, lest his wrath may come on a sudden, and
in the time of vengeance He may destroy them.

The Lenten Regulations will be the same as have been
observed in this diocese during the Lent of the past year.
Availing 0111rselves of the dispensing power communicated to us
by the Holy 866, we peimit the use of flesh meat on 311 the
Sundays, Mondays, and Tuesday s: on all Thursdays, except the
first Thursday and Thursday 111 Holy Week3 on 311 Saturdays,
except the first 831111(131,1116 Saturday of the Quatuor Tenses,
and Holy Saturday. The use of fleshy meat 18 prohibited during
the first four days and the last four days of Lent, as well 38 011
1116 Wednesdays and F rldaVS in 1116 other weeks, and 011 the
Saturday of the Quatuor Tenses—the 20111 of February. It is
to be observed that on those days 111 which flesh meat is allowed,
fish 1s not permitted at the same meal. Eggs are allowed on
all days except the first and last Wednesdays and all the F ridays
in Lent. Milk and white meats are allowed on every day except
Ash Wednesday, Spy Wednesday, and Good Friday3 and on
Sundays white meats and eggs may be used at every meal.
Should anyone, 011 account of ill health or some other just
cause, require a still greater relaxation, they may have recourse
to their spiritual directors, who are hereby authorised to grant
such further dispensation 38 they may conscientiously deem
necessary. The clergy, in their opening Lenten Instructions,
will fully exp lain the nature of the fast of Lent, and the causes
which excuse from the observance of the fast or of the
abstinence.

Whilst the Church, through compassion for the infirmities
and sufferings of her children, has permitted the rigour of her
laws 10 be relaxed m their favour, her doctrine on the necessity
of penance, sels· denial, and mortification continues unchanged.
She therefore expects that those who may avail themselves of
the disp ensation now granted will compensate for the lenity with
which 11161 are treated by more fervent and frequent prayerS,
by libeial 311118 10 the poor, and by the exercise of the other
