LETTER OF THE IRISH Brsrrors 'ro MR. GRATTAN, THE 2N1>
FEBRUARY, 1795.

(From the Diocesan Archives‚ Dublin.)
Sus,—

We, the underwritten Roman Catholic Prelates of Ireland ‚
having, on behalf of ourselves and absent brethren, already
expressed our wants and wishes respecting clerical education,
m the Minutes submitted to your revision and correction, take
the liberty at present to explain some of them more particu-
larly, in order to remove misapprehensions, which may furnish
an occasion of perplexity or equivocation.

As the principle of our application to Parliament seems
universally admitted, we shall confine ourselves to those parts
only of the detail to which, as we hear, objections have been made.

‘It is said, that as our plan extends to the education of the
Lmty, the appointment of Professors to lecture on Philosophy,
Mathematics, Rhetoric, and the languages, which are common
to clergy and laity, should not be vested in the Bishops only,
because these branches of learning are not intimately connected

with religion and morality, and much less with the peculiar
duties of ecclesiastics.
