candidates for Holy Orders shall be proficients in certain
branches of learning, which are not included in the exercises of
the University of Dublin.

That even where the Roman Catholic is the established
religion, candidates for Holy Orders are obliged to receive the
most important part of their education in seminaries distinct
from the public Universities.

That many persons who destine themselves to the Ministry
of the Roman Catholic religion in Ireland, are not sufficiently
opulent to bear the expense of education in the University of
Dublin, and of constant residence in the metropolis 3 it is, there-
fore, the more necessary to provide literary instruction for them
on more easy conditions3 and although the liberality of the
present heads of the University might induce them to receive
persons on the foundation, yet neither could a sufficient number·
be thus accommodated‚ nor would it prove grateful to the
feelings of the parties, and many other inconveniences might
arise, if young men should observe great temporal advantages
conferred upon their fellow-students, whilst they were restricted
to the humble walk of a subordinate ministry.

From these considerations‚ and conceiving that piety, learn-
ing, and subordination would be thereby essentially promoted‚
your Excellency's Memorialists are induced to unclertake the
establishment of proper places for the education of the clerical
youth of their communion. Being advised by counsel that his
Majesty's Royal License is necessary, in order legally to secure
the funds which they may appropriate for that purpose, they
humbly beg leave to solicit your Excellency's recommendation
to our most gracious Sovereign, that he will be pleased to grant
his Royal License for the endowment of academies or semina-
ries for educating and preparing young persons to discharge
the duties of Roman Oatholic Clergymen in this kingdom,
under ecclesiastical superiors of their own communion.
