cutors, for fulfilling all and singular the premises‚ the said
testator has made over all his goods whatsoever and whereso-
ever, revoking every other will, if any has been by him made,
and wishing that this his will should receive confirmation in the
best way, mode, and form in which it could and ought to pre-
vail. In testimony of which I, Cormac Dalachan, the aforesaid
Curate, have affixed my sign manual to the present will. It was
made in the house of Solomon MacEgan,* in the village of

Coole (Oufle), in the year of our Lord 1590, 10th J uly.

CORMAC DALACHAN‚ witness, Curate.

“ These underwritten were the witnesses at the time of
making this will.

“ J OHN Doms, a priest. Witness.
“ I am N1AL O'SHEILL. I am HUGH O'SHE1LL, a witness.

“ It was proved by the oath of Hugh Dalachan.’'

The above is the translation of the will given by O'Donovan.
The original is in Latin.

N .B.—The first mention of the O'Flahillys, afterwards
MacOoghhms, in the Four Masters, is so late as the year 1136.

unable to determine.

The church which the Very Rev. Charles Ooghlan restored

by some MacDermott's Church, which had been begun by
Cormac MacConnamacboct‚ were this year repaired and com-
pleted by F lathnertagh O'Loyngsy.'' Local tradition states
that it was called MacDermott's Ohurch because a family of
that name purchased a burial-place in it. Mr. O'Donovan
states explicitly that it seemed to him somewhat odd that the
great cathedral of Olonmacnoise should be called after the
MacDermotts of Moylurg† Mr. O’Donovan also thinks that
this church is the most modern of them all, and in all its parts,
with the exception of one narrow, round-headed window and a
stone-roofed chamber, which it lights.
