In the Third Council of Lateran, is it not understood that,
amongst the punishments decreed against the Albigenses, this
was determined: “Illorum subditi et vassali relaxatos se nove·
rint a debito fidelitatis dominii et totius obsequii donec in tanta
iniquitate permanserint'’ ?—In the Council just mentioned, it
would seem to have been decreed that, if the Albigenses perse-
vered in their iniquitous practices, their vassals were to be
absolved from their allegiance3 but, as that assembly was as
much a congress of princes and lords as an ecclesiastical Council,
it is but fair to admit that its decrees were known to its lay
members as well as to the bishops3 and as the former have
never reclaimed against their publication, we must conclude
that they themselves concurred in framing them. This being
vonce admitted, it will naturally follow that the canons alluded
to ought to be considered as the civil laws of the State rather
than those of the Church. But, if it be supposed that a Council
-or Pope, or any authority whatever, assumed the right of ab·
solving subj ects from their allegiance to their sovereign‚ Ι would
-disregard their decision, and consider the subjects by no means
freed from their obligations of fidelity. Not only would Ι
despise and disregard such a decree, but, if a subject of the
sovereign in question, Ι would consider it my religious duty to
openly resist it, and advise such of the people as might be com-
mitted to my care to remain unshaken in their allegiance. Ι
cannot, however, admit the necessity of ever reducing this doc-
trine to practice, being fully convinced that the Church will
never assume such a right.

Will you not consider it your duty, as Professor of Dogmatic

Theology in Maynooth, sincerely and ex (mimo to impress that
principle P—When Ι shall have occasion to treat that subject, Ι am
resolved to inculcate the substance of the answer Ι have just
given, because Ι consider it to be founded on truth ; and I shall
endeavour, when Ι have an opportunity of doing so, to impress
those sentiments on the minds of my pupils.
. Do you, therefore, hold that those canons in no degree bind
Roman Catholics at the present day 12-1 hold that those canons
dodnot *pind the Catholics of the present day, either directly or
in irect y.

You consider that they were statutes deriving force from
the authority of the civil and ecclesiastical powers of Europe
applied to the then existing state of things P—Yes.

And not applicable to the present state of Europe or the
world P—By no means.

You are aware, perhaps, that Boniface pronounced a sentence
of deposition against Philip the Fair ε do you understand that
Pope Boniface‚ in doing so, acted by virtue of the authority which
