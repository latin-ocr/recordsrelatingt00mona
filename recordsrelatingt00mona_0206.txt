he derived from temporal power, or by virtue of any authority he·
possessed de jure divino, as Head of the Ghurch and Vicar of
Christ upon earth, which Roman Catholics hold him to be ?—I
conceive, first, that if he assumed any such authority jure divino,
he assumed it Wrongly: and, secondly‚ 1 think it probable that,
whatever authority he exercised, he did not exercise it jure·
divino, but by virtue of a kind of accessorial power given to him,
perhaps, by the sovereigns of Europe. Besides, Pope Boniface,
after using many arguments to show that he possessed the
power of disposing of kingdoms and of deposing princes, when he-
comes to a decision, does not decree that he is vested with his
authority jure dz'w'no; he only says: “ Porro subesse Romano

’ Pontifici omnem creaturam declaramus, dicimus et pronunciamus
esse omnino de necessitate salutis.'' Now, if these words be
understood in a spiritual sense, they must be admitted as orthodox
by every Catholic, as we hold that the Pope is the visible Head os·
the Church, and, as such, superior in spiritual concerns to any of
its members.

Does not Bossuet state, in defending the Gallican declara-
tion, and denying the civil and temporal power of the Pope,
something to this effect ε that although some Popes have under-
taken to pronounce sentence of deposition, and though, into
Bulls of deposition, they have contrived to introduce general
passages partly referring to their spiritual power, to the power
of the keys, yet that no Pope distinctly and expressly ever
referred this power of deposition to the power which he derived
from Christ as Head of the Church ?—The Popes who seem,
according to the words of the Bull issued by them, to have
assumed in a certain degree the power of deposing kings,
though they made use of strong language, Ι believe they never
say in express words that they act jure dicz'no in so much as-
they are Popes; and that answer may be confirmed by this
observation, that although many of the Popes might have ap-
peared anxious that the world should believe that they enjoyed
lheir authority, yet, in support of that pretension, they never
decreed anything as obliging people to believe it ; they merely
assumed it, and a matter of fact informs us that that assump-
tion was afterwards contradicted‚ because reclamations were
made from all parts of the world to which those Bulls were
issued ; and it ought to be observed, that persons so reclaiming
never were deemed heretical; that, on the contrary, they enjoyed
communion with the Pope equally with others, which convinces»
us that even the Pope never assumed this authority as forming
anything like a Divine right, or as taxing those persons with a
deficiency of saith who embraced the contrary opinion. Ι beg
leave, however, to add, that I do not mean to excuse the ambi·
