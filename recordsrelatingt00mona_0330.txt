which would supply a remedy to so painful a disorder should,
, therefore, effect two things. F irst, it should define accurately
the limits within which the mind may legitimately exercise itself
in the search for truth : and, secondly, it should give unity to>
science by pointing out a secure pathway by which the elevation

of a universal philosophy may be reached. The Positive Philo· ⁴ }

sophy undertakes this double task. It endeavourS‚ in the first
place, to discard for ever from among the objects of thought
all that regards the essentia] nature oi things, their causes,
either efficient or final, all speculation as to their origin or
destination. “ We have no knowledge of anything but pheno-
mena: and our knowledge of phenomena is relative, not
absolute. We know not the essence, nor the real mode of
production of any fact, but only its relations to other facts in
the way of succession or of similitude. These relations are
constant, that is, always the same in the same circumstances.
The constant resemblances which link phenomena together,

, ' and the consequent sequences which unite them as antecedent

and consequent, are termed their laws. The laws of phenomena
are all we know respecting them. Their essentia] nature, andr
their ultimate causes, either efficient or final, are unknown and
inscrutable to us.’'

This golden rule has not been always gra'sped by the human
mind. On the contrary, M. Comte assures us, as a matter of
history, that two other methods of philosophising, antagonistic
to his method and to each other, have successively swayed
humanity, as well in the aggregate as in individuals. The law
of progress thus embraces three distinct stages, called by him
respectively the Theological, the Metaphysical, and the Posi-
tive. Mr. Mill believes that these tex-ms„ especially in the
English language, are not quite suited to the purpose, as they
excite ideas other than those' intended. Hence, instead of the
Theological he would prefer to speak of the Personal or Voli-
tional explanation of nature: instead of the Metaphysical, the
Abstractional or Ontological: instead of the Positive, the
Phenomenal or Experiential.

In the Theological stage, the mind regards the phenomena
of the universe as operations of divinities. F irst, each object
is looked upon as animated. Next, each entire class of obj ects
or events is believed to be under the superintendence of an
invisible Being. F inally, the multitude of divinities is merged.
in a single God, who made the world, and guides it either by
His continued action, or by specially interfering from time to-
time.

In the Metaphysical stage, phenomena are accounted for by·
being ascribed not to volitions‚ but to realised abstractions.
