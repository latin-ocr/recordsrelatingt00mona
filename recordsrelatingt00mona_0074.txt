54 mocESE OF ARDAGH.

in such a fantastic fashion, as that it cannot be said to be either
lying or standing, and yet presenting such a pile of huge masses
of dangerously inclining stonework‚ as to remind one of the
Leaniny Tower at Pisa. It holds its threatening and unsteady
position on a rath or mound, surrounded by a fosse. However,
if we closely examine and compare them with other similar
ruins, or with existing monasteries in Europe, I think that,
even in their decayed and crumbling condition, we shall find
much to admire and console us for the loss they bespeak. Just
as our grief is sometimes alleviated by lookin g on the portraits
of departed friends and recalling their virtues, so, too, these
unroofed edifices remind us of the saintly and fair forms, the
kindly and edifying demeanour, ever-dauntless courage and
sels-sacrifice, of the good friends and fathers who lived and
ruled here, and thus bring consolation to our hearts. But their
home is now deserted and unroofed.* The noise of royal car-
riages and the voices of royal visitors are no longer heard around
the sacred spot. The procession of pale-faced, ascetic monks,
clothed in the rough garments of the early ages, moving out
slowly and solemnly to meet the dead bodies of kings, nobles,
and chieftains‚ and convey them to their quiet graves, amidst
the harmonicus chanting of the psalms and prayers for the dead,
is no more seen.

The beautiful Bearnan of Ciaran.

“ The blessing of the Keeper of the Bearnan,
And the blessing of Ciaran of elnam,
Both descend alike

Upon every repentant head.

And his Mata-rnalla,
And his gospel of friendship‚
Are not without comfort to chiefs.

‘³‘ It is hoped one of these churches will soon be re-roofed for sepulchral
urposes. It is a pity that the most celebrated Campo Santo in ancient
Ireland (almost all the royal families had aburial-plot there) should be without
a mortuary chapel wherein the ceremonial for interment might be performed
according to the full rite.
