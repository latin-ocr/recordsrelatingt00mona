REcoLLEc'noNS OF GRANARD, co. LONGFORD. 347

which he placed, as Bishop, Guasact, the son of Milcho, who:
was formerly his own master or rather torturer (tyrant).''

His feast is commemorated on the 24th J anuary. Here Γ
may observe 1hat all antiquarians and writers on ecclesiasticas
matters who have touched the subject of the antiquities of this
locality, have written of Lerha, now Abbey-lara, as one of the
most precious and sacred possessions of Granard. When, for
example, they write of “ St. Mary's, Granard,” it is of the old
Monastery of Lerha they speak. 1 note this fact because
Granard and Abbey-lara, being now distinct parisheS, and
more than an Irish mile apart‚ a medem traveller and inquirer
anxious to see the ruins of the famous Oisterian Abbey, founded
by Sir Richard Tuite, and called St. Mary’s, Granard, would
scarcely think of going to look for it at Abbey·lara; and yet
it is only there he finds it. Sir Richard Tuite performed
and left after him two great works of different orders; one

rity of the Annals of Louylz Oi. In 1205, Sir Richard Tuite
founded an abbey here, to the honour of the Β. V. Mary, for
monks of the Oistercian Order, whom he brought from St„
Mary's Abbey, Dublin, an abbey rendered famous, in 1551, by
the public disputation which took place within its walls, at the
special invitation of the Viceroy, in the presence of the clergy
and a vast concourse of people, and was terminated by contri-¹
buting a fatal blow to Protestantism in Ireland. vIt was that
same abbey which gave to the See of Ardagh, in 1647, Patrick
J oseph Plunkett‚ who, at one period of his reign, was the
only bishop living), moviny, ,and pefforminy the sanctiores of
leis 722·ng office in Ireland, He ordained‚ after his return
from exile, two hundred priests from various dioceses of
Ireland, there being no other resident bishop in the kingdom
save the bed-ridden Bishop of Kilmore. In 1211, Sir Richard
Tuite was interred in this Abbey, having been crushed to death
by the falling of a tower in Athlone. He was a brave, noble
and qenerous seul, His representatives now reside at Sonna,
Co. Meath, but unhappily they do not belong to the Ghurch of'
their great ancestor. St. Mary's, Granard, so nobly founded
and richly endowed‚ was pillaged, rifled, and despoiled about a
century after its erection. In 1315, Edward Bruce, commander
of the Scots, advanced upon Granard, burned it, and after-
wards seized and plundered the Monastery. This was the third
burning of Granard recorded by the Annalists. To one of'
these burnings an unfortunate dispute between the chieftains

of Breffny East and Breffy West, led. The first took place in
