This building is 01 the same extent with the abbey 01 Slig0;
but it is thought to be rather inferior in the execution. The

seal 01 this abbey was found about twenty years ago. A bishop
called ¹‚'Dr. Thadeus O’Rorke was buried here. Also Dr.

Bernard O'Rorke, Bishop. He was Bishop 01 Κ113113. Several
priests are also buried here, some 01 whom were called by the
honourable name 01 O'Rorke. It is tolerably well cared since
the Board 01 Works got charge 01 11.

11 is said amongst the people that it was 101· 3 long time
disputed whether the Parish 01 Kilanummery, in which it is
situated, belonged to the Diocese 01 Ardagh or Kilmore‚ and on
that account it was called the Olcurolz of Contention, but it is
*more properly called the Ohurch on the Ridge.

J amestown. A F ranciscan Friary was erected here to—
wards the end 01 the thirteenth century. It was the centre 01
stirring and important events in the days 01 the Kilkenny
ι00111011011311011. J amestown was formerly a borough sending
two members to the Irish Parliament.

Leitrim. An abbey was founded here at a very early period
'by St. M. Leigus, Bishop 01 Liath-dromen. Although only a
village now, it must have been once a place 01 note, in that it
,gives name to the barony and county.

Mohill. An abbey was built here by St. Manchan for
canons Regular, about the year 608. It was dedicated to the
,Blessed Virgin and was possessed 01 11111011 lauded territory. At
the suppression 01 monasteries its possessions were confiscated.

Athlone. A monastery for Conventual Franciscans was
[founded here in 1240, by Charles O'Oonnor, Prince 01 Oonnaught.
He did not live to finish it. Sir Henry Dillon completed it and
was interred within its walls in 1244. There was also es-
tablished here a Dominican Convent on the site now occupied by
the Protestant parish church. The tower 01 the old Dominican
Church still remains and is situated near the Protestant edifice.
It was from that tower the signal was given 101· William’s army
to cross the river, 111 1691. 11 is said the bell rung on that
occasion is the same bell that is used to this day in calling the
Protestant congregation to their meetings. There is no other
remnant 01 the Dominicans in this town, whilst the Franciscans
are in a flourishing condition, spiritually and materially, owing
in a great measure to the indefatigable labours 01 the present
vdistinguished Guardian‚ the Very Rev. T. J. Rossitor. The
old Franciscan Friary was situated 10 the west 01 the Poor—
Hense, from which it is separated only by the Goosan Road.

Gallen. This monastery was erected near the present town
of Ferbane, by St. Canoe, a royal pilgrim 110111 wales, in 492.
