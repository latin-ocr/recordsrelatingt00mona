The enclosure is rectangular and measures fifty yards' by

Aybout the centre of this Oashel stands a rectangular cell of
extreme antiquity, measuring about eighteen by ten feet, the
walls being over three feet in width or thickness. The doorway
is square-headed. The lintel passes through the entire thickness of
the wall. There is no sign of any mode of hanging or fastening
a door—the sides are inclined, and there is no window in the
sides of the building. This is the cell which tradition states
Manchan built for his mother, St. Mella. How appallinq was not
the rz'qour and severity qfsaozetz'ty in those days J Ivy now mantles
this curious cell, and the enclosure or Cashel is planted with trees.

But the most interesting object of all connected with this
celebrated monastic foundation is the shrine of St. Manchan.

’ Scrinium Sancti Manchani the Annalists declare to have been

called, opus pulcherimum quod fecit opifex in Hibernia.

This venerable shrine certainly holds a conspicuous place
amongst Irish ecclesiastical antiquities. Being a. monument of
very high antiquity, it cannot fail to awaken at all times a lively
interest amongst antiquarians, affording, as it does, an illustra--
tion of a class of obj ects formerly numerous, but now very rare.
“ It was covered by Roderick O’Oonor‚ and an embroidering of
gold was carried over it by him in as good a style as a relic was
ever covered in Ireland.’'—Four Masters.

There is, and always was, an intimate connexion between
shrines, reliques, pilgrimages, and processions. The shrine
containing a relique was, at first, a plain chest of wood.
Gradually it became the subject of more or less ornament in
proportion to the veneration attached to the object it contained.
Shrines originally portable, thus became in course of time large
and stately structures, and were set up in churches for the
veneration of the faithful. The origin of shrines is traceable to
a very remote period. The Israelites, for example, when they
were departing from Egypt, took with them the bones of J oseph
(according to his own direction) and kept them during their
many years' journeyings into the Promised Land. When the
dead man was restored to life on touching the bones of the
Prophet Eliseus, when diseases departed and evil spirits went out
of them to whom handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched
the body of St. Pau] were applied, the foundation was laid for
that veneration which found one mode of expression in the
decoration of the shrine. The veneration amongst Christians
for reliques and shrines began in the Apostolic times. St.
Ignatius, who was a disciple of St. John the Evangehst, and who
is believed to have been the child that our Lord took in his arms,
was martyred at Rome, A.D. 107, and his bones were afterwards
