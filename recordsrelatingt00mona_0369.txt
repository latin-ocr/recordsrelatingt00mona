Granard. The Monastz'con Hiberniam contains the following
1·ῗεῖἶὲξὲ ggglarding the possessions of this Abbey at the time 01

“ On the surrender of the abbey the said Richard was seized of two caru-
cates of land, with their appurtenances, in Olonemore, of the yearly value,
besides reprises, of 138. 4d.; four carucates in Lerha, of the yearly value,

1111100 of the rectory of Granard, of the yearly value, besides repriseS, of

From this extract it is evident that St. Mary’S‚ Granard‚
was a wealthy institution. Like so many other abbeys, it had
been founded by the generous and powerful as a fitting but
humble tribute to the great Author 01 οΠ good gifts. A con-v
secrated sanctuary 01 prayer, an asylum 01 charity, a bulwark
01 religion and 00101100 11 was indeed, and, moreover, a welcome
home 101· 1110 destitute and afflicted. If its abbots held large
estates it was in trust 101 religious purposes ; and their tenants
were happy and comfortable. Oases 01 oppression, rack-renting‚.„
and eviction were unknown to them until the crozier had been
exchanged 101 1110 00011110. But the Parliament under St. Leger
sat in 1541, and the Act was passed granting 011 1110 abbeys and
priories to his Majesty the King‚ who distributed their posses-·-
sions amongst his nobles, courtiers‚ and others, reserving 10
himself certain annual rents. The work 01 public plunder‚ thus
commenced under the schismatical Henry, was continued with
increased vigour and rapacity by the heretioal Elizabeth. A?
furious and destructive tempest had indeed been raised, and it
raged and rolled with unabated energy during her unhappy
reign over the Ohurch 01 Ireland‚ until the sanctuary, with its
loveliness and religion, with its blessings‚ appeared alike
involved in the same wreck. St. Mary's‚ Granard, when the
0101111 had subsided was to be found only in ruins, whence it
has not risen even to this day.

The last historical recollection in connexion with 11110 old
town, which 1 shall presently reproduce is a most praiseworthy·
effort, made towards the close 01 1001 century by one 01 110 own
sons, although ’1111110011 111 exile, to save the Irish harp from
extinction. Mr. Walker wrote in 1786, when he published his<
history 01 Ι11011 barcis, “that 1110 0011001 01 harp-players was⁴
