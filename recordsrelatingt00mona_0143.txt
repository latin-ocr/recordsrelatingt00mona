EPISCOPAL succassmx IN CLONMACXOISE. 123

Havin g formed there a community of eight, in the year 1717,
'he was appointed by his Provincial, the Very Rev. Hugh Calanau,
their confessor and general manager, an office which he held
for many years. On the 24th July, 1721, 110 was raised to the
⁴dignity of Provincial of his own Order. The circumstances of
his elevation were notable. It was the first election in their
Order, made on Irish soil, since 1698, the year of their expulsion-
He was not long Provincial until he succeeded in getting Dr.
McMahon, Archbishop of Armagh, to establish the Sienna
Oonvent at Drogheda. The first Superioress of this venerable
Dominican Convent was Catherine Plunkett, niece to the
martyred Amhbishop, Oliver Plunkett, whose head is preserved
there in a beautiful silver shrine. Having thus employed, for
=some years, his great energy and infiuence in reviving the fallen
¹greatness of 1118 Order, he set out for Rome 111 1725. Whilst
there he was elected and nominated to the See of Clonmacnoise.
The Holy Father was much impressed by his worth, and, as a
mark of special respect, consecrated him with his own hands in
the Quirinal Palace, on the 29th Sept„ 1725. The prelates
assisting Benedict the XIII. on that occasion were Archbishop
of Oozenza and the Bishop of Giovenazzo, both of the same
Order. In 1729 Dr. MacEgan was appointed to the Diocese of
Ferns, but it does not appear that 110 took possession of that
«See ; for in the same year he was translated to Meath, where 110
lived during the remainder of his days. Together with his

J ames' Cemetery. His grave cannot be identified now, although
the Very Rev. Dr. Russell, Ο.Ρ., and others, have zealously

The following interesting letter was written to Dr. Mac-
Egan on the occasion of his election to Glonmacnoise by the
Very Rev. Thomas Rippoll, Superior of the Dominican Order
