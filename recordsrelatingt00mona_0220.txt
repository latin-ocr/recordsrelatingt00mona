and to every successive Pope the divine principle which ani-
mated Himself? N 03 Ι could not be presumed to give such
an answer P

You hold as all Christians do that our Lord Himself could

the divinity 11 Ι admitted that he could either sin or err.

You do not mean to say that he meant to give any such
power to St. Peter or to his successors, but only to say that 110
(lid not extend any power to them beyond the power he exercised
Himself P Certainly.

Roman Catholics and members 01 1110 Established Church,
and all who hold the divine inspiration 01 1110 Sacred ScriptureS.
understand that the ApostleS, each and every one 01 111010, 10
propounding the 101111 was 10101111110 P Undoubtedly.

But it has never entered into any person's mind, therefore, to
consider that every bishop, who 18 held in every church which
has bishops to be a successor 01 the Apostles⁹ to be infallible P
I stated at an early stage 01 1110 examination that each 01 1110
Apostles immediately received the gift- 01 infallibility 11010 God,
and I also stated that it was 0 1001101 01 great doubt whether
that infallibility, even when pronouncing on matters 01 101111,
devolved upon the Pope. I never asserted that the same 1010111-
bility devolved upon other bishops.

The Roman Catholic doctrine with respect to the perpetual
infallibility is rested upon the passage 01 Scripture where our
Lord promises to be with His Ohurch to the end 01 1110 world P
That is one 01 1110 passages brought forward to prove it.

That is understood to be a promise given to the whole
Church P Our Lord's promise 01 being in 0 special manner
with His Ohurch. The text is, “ Go teach all nations, and
behold I shall be with you to the end 01 11100.” Τ1118 promise
was made to the Apostles in as much as they were teachers or
doctors, and as they were not to continue in that capacity to the
end 01 111110, 1110 divine promise must have included their suc-
cessors. Therefore, Christ promised 10 110 with the Apostles
and their lawful successors 101 ever ; but it cannot be supposed
that he would thus be present with any body 01 men who
could teach errors in matters 01 0101001 importance.

Roman 0011101108 10 holding that the Pope is 10101111110 01-
tribute infallibility to him, not upon the principle that 1010111-
bility was given to each 01 1110 Apostles, but upon the principle
that infallibility was given to the Ghurch, and that 110 represents
the Church P The Catholics who hold that the Pope is 1010111-
ble, by no means maintain that he enjoys that gift as the mere
successor to an Apostle, but because he succeeds to St. Peter
