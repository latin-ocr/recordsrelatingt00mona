the foundation of our saith, and the Church the only sufficient
expounder of the different articles contained in the Revealed
Word of God.

Which Revelation, according to the Catholic doctrine, may
be known either by the written Word or by the Apostolic Tra-
dition P—Either by the written Word or by Tradition.

Suppose a Council were to make a law ordaining that the
Pope should depose the king, or should depose any heretical
prince, as one of the Councils of Lateran ordained that the Pope
should depose the princes who favoured the Albigensian heresy,
would you consider such a decree or decision or law as pro-
pounding an article of saith, or only as coming within the prin-
ciple laid down by Bossuet in the words: “ Multa etiam sunt
decreta, etc.’' ?—As God has given to His Church no power what-
ever of: interfering in the temporal concerns of princeS, and as
Catholics hold that a General Council, which represents that
Church, is infallible, Ι cannot admit that any such assembly
would decree that princes should be deposed.

Do you understand that those Councils which decreed that
heretical princes should be deposed were speaking by virtue of
authority enjoyed by them as representing the civil and eccle-
siastical States of Europe, and ordaining matters of prudence
merely, or as Councils representing the whole Church‚ and pro-
pounding articles of saith ⁸?-I consider, if ever the fact of any
such decree took place, it emanated, not from an assembly
representing the Universal Church congregated to decide on
matters of saith, but that it must have proceeded from a mixed
authority—that is, from persons in that Council holding as well
temporal as ecclesiastical power.

Has it not been made a matter of question by writers of con-
siderable eminence, whether the decree of the Fourth Council
of Lateran, which is considered as directing depositions in certain
cases, be or not spurious P—Some historians consider that the
canon in which that authority seems to be inserted and assumed
is spurious, because, I believe, they consider that for some hundred
years after the Council, no such canon was found*

ἥ Subsequently added by witness :—Many eminent writers doubt of the
authenticity of this canon, as the writers of that age assert that nothing was
seriously discussed in the Council except the means of recovering the Holy
Lands. We find this account of the transactions of that assembly in the writings
of Matthew Paris, Naucleries Platina, and other authors of much eminence.
But granting that the canon referred to is really authentic, it cannot be inferred
that· the Church assumed the right of absolving subjects from their allegiance, or
of disposing of property, as the words of the Canon might give reason to sup-
pose ; because that Council was composed of princes and temporal lords as well
as bishops, and, consequently, they might enact penalties against the Albi-
genses, who, according to all historians, committed most enormous excesseS,
and d1sturbed the peace of the State as well as that of the Church.
