BOUNDARIES OF ARDAGH DIOCESE. 15

William MCawsee or MacCasac,* succeeded in 1367.
Before his election he was a secular priest. This prelate died
of a fall from his horse in 1373, but it is not stated that his
death was immediate. In August, the same year, great discords
arose concerning the election of a successor. For Charles
O’Farrel was elected by one part of the Chapter, while another
part made choice of Richard O'FerraL Dean of Ardagh ; and a
third adhered to John Aubry, a Dominican Friar of Trim.
The supporters, however, of Charles O'Ferral triumphed over
their opponents; for he was consecrated Bishop of Ardagh in
1373. The Annallists say he was a man remarkable for
learning, piety and charity to the poor. He died in 1378.
