52 moonsn or ARDAGH.

To this terrible plague Ciaran fell a victim. In the 33rd
year of his age (a remarkable year), quievit in Domine, ΑΛ). 549,
and it is added, in the Annals of Clonmacnoise, that his body
was buried in the “ Little Ohurch’' at Olonmacnoise: “Beati
mortui qui in Domino moriuntur.'' His feast is celebrated on
the 9th of September, each recurring year, and during the
Octave, in this Diocese of Olonmacnoise‚ where it is a double of
the first class. The present Bishop of Ardagh and Olonmac-
noise, Right Rev. Dr. Woodlock, having compiled from the
Bollandists proper Lessons for the Second N octurn of the Office
of our Saint, obtained for them the approbation of the Holy See,
through the good offices of the Right Rev. Dr. Moran, Bishop
of Ossory, now Oardinal Archbishop of Sydney, who kindly
revised the manuscript.

“ Sancte Kierane, ora pro nobis.'’

I am aware that the year of the death of this great man, of
whom St. Columba wrote in his poem of praise—

“ Quantum Christi, O Apostolum mundo misisti hominem
Lucerna hujus insulae lucens lucerna mirabilis‚’'

has been variously stated. 1 am aware that the Bollandists
have attempted to prove that he lived until A.D. 570, but the
year already given seems to me supported by the ablest and
most accurate writers. Archdall, Ussher, Ware, Lanigan‚ sup-

port this date, and the F our Masters in some editions, whilst in
others the date is fixed at 548. And now, standing on the hal-

reckoned the famous Imda Chiarain, or cow-hide conch, 011 which St. Ciaran
expired. It was venerated as a most precious relic, being hallowed by the
death of our saint, and it was regarded as a special privilege to permit those
who were infirm to repose upon this couch. The Annals of Clonmacnoise state
that the remains was interred within the “Eglais Beg,'' or Little Church, in
which he died ; and hence in aftertimes it was known as “Teampul Chiarain.''
The Irish Life also says, that besides the relies of its founder, it was hallowed
by the remains of many thousand “with the relies of Paul and Peter which
Benen left, and which are there enshrined ; and the relies of MaoDall, that is
a disciple of the Prophet, and the shrine of the aiged, that is to say, the Prophet
which a certain pious person saw transported by Angels to Ciaran’s burial
place. ’' It must be remarked that the contraction used in this last passage for
the word Prophet is ambiguous, it probably, however, refers to Caencombrace,
who was venerated as a Prophet in Clonmacnoise, as we see in the Martyrology
of Donegal, page 199. In Miss Stokes’s Christian Inscriptions, page 76, there
is an ancient Irish poem on Clonmacnoise, which ends with the strophe :—

“ There are a hundred Ciarans saints of high heaven,
ratramni&rassssgfissessfxssffg‘a
In the city of the prayerful one.’'

In the vellum MS. preserved in Trinity College Library, Dublin (H. 2, 7,
eol. 232), there is also an Irish poem entitled “The Prayer of Protection of

Oiai-anf which has the following strophes on the heavenly treasures of Clon-
macnolse :-—
