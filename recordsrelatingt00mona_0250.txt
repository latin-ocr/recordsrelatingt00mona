see it begin to mock him, saying z This man began to build, and‘
was not able to finish.’'—Luke, xiv. 28, 29, 30.

Ι 0001088, dearest brethren, Ι am constantly reminded of'
this passage 01 1110 Gospel, as I behold our noble cathedral yet
unfinished. But why am I reminded of it? Is it to reproach
myself, or cast a reproach upon the diocese? Or, if exempt
from reproach, are we to resign ourselves to the misery of re-
flecting that the undertaking was too great, and that we must
give it up in despair, as a work we can never finish? Far from
me such ideas, and God forbid Ι should lead you to such dis--
heartening conclusions. No, dearly beloved brethren ; but the
nearer this great diocesan work is to its completion, and the
more I am convinced that we can complete it, the more do Ι
desire 130 800 11 actually completed, that for the glory of G0d‚
and for 13110 honour 01 1110 clergy and faithful 01 1110 diocese, it
may stand forth in all its greatness and majesty, and proclaim
to the world that they who undertook it—the bishop, and the-
priests, and the people-who undertook this vast diocesan work,
undertook no vain or impossible project—they undertook it,
AND THEY HAVE FINISHED 1T.

With a vastness 01 conception, 01 which the work 118011 18
destined to be an imperishable monument, the late illustrious„
bishop 01 11118 diocese projected the cathedral, not as a church
101 1110 town or parish 01 Longford, but according to the proper
idea 01 0 00111οᾶ1οΙ, 08 1110 01101011 01 1110 entire diocese. As
such he proposed it 10 1110 clergy and people, and it was as such
the clergy and people adopted it. Ι 11011, therefore, only the
humble part to act, 01 walking in the path Ι 1011011 opened be-
fore me. Views were formed, plans were fixed, resolutione
were adopted3 earnestness and good-will everywhere abounded.
As soon, therefore, as I was placed in the position which I so
unworthily occupy amongst you, Ι 1011 Ι should be grievously
accountable 11 Ι did not at once avail myself 01 1110 co·0peration
Ι saw ready for prosecuting the good and glorious work. Ι
therefore appealed a first time, and with a generosity as promptv
as it was universal, you placed 10 my hands the means 01 re-
suming the works, which had for some time remained sus-
pended. I appealed a second time, and with a no less generous
effort you enabled me to proceed, without stop or stay, till the*
church was opened and solemnly dedicated to divine worship.
And behold, dearly beloved brethren, Ι venture now to appeal
to you a third time: and will Ι 8057 11, 01 will Ι leave it 10 you·
to say, that you will come forward a third time, and by ax
crowning effort achieve the completion 01 1110 work ⁴?

The works remaining to be done are chiefly those 0000001οὦ
