ful a rival, ordered him to leave the territory of Meath.
Diarmid, accompanied by a devoted band of followerS, repaired
to the Upper Shannon and there lived on the hospitality of his
friends on both sides of the river. Thus did he spend his life
for nine years, the period of his opponent's reign. About this
time Oiaran and his devoted disciples came up from Athlone,
after quitting Lough Ree in boats, and lauded at Olonmacnoise.
Diarmid happened to be in the neighbourhood on the river,
went on shore, and followed the strangers. Having reached the
“ Hill of Wells'' where St. Oiaran stopped, he approached
and found the saint with a pole in his hand endeavouring to
plant it as the first pole of a new church.

‘⁴ What work is about being done here ?'’ said Diarmid. “ The
erecting of a small church,’' said the saint. “ Well indeed may
{hat be its name‚’' said Diarmid, “Eglais Beg,⁷' or “Little

*hurch.''

“ Plant the pole with me,'' said the saint, “ and let my hand
be above your hand on it, and your hand and your sovereign
sway shall be over the men of Erinn before long.'' ‘⁴ How can
that be‚'' said Diarmid, “ since Tuathal is Monarch of Erinn
and I am exiled ξ ”

“ God is powerful for that‚'' said Oiaran. They then set up
the pole, and Diarmid made an offering of the place to Grod
and St. Oiaran.

Diarmid had a foster-brother amongst his followers. His
name was Maelmora. When he heard the saint's prophetie -
words he resolved to verify them. With this purpose he set

 

St. Finnian cherished a special predilection for Ciaran, and when obliged
to be absent for a time from his disciples, deputed “ that youth,” as he
used to say, to preside in his stead. He saw one day in vision two moons of
the colour of gold, one of which moved over the sea to the north, the other
over the centre of Erin. This, he explained, as referring to SS. Columkille
and Uiaran—the former, with the brightness of his nobility and princely
descent3 the latter, with the mild radiance of his oharity and meekness.
Among his companions at the school of Finnian was St. Brendan of Birr, who
was famed for his spirit of prophecy. He said one day to St. Ciaran, that
the same difference would be between his own monastery and that of Ciaran,
as between the rivers on which they would be placed, that is, the little
Brosnagh and the Shannon.

Giaran went, on one occasion, to Tuathal Maelgarbh, King of Erin (Aa).
533 to 544), to solicit the freedom of a bond slave. The favour was granted,
and the rich gifts were made to him by the king, but all these he distributed
among the poor. When Ciaran was about to take his leave from Clonard,
St. Finnian offered his cathair or monastery to him; but Ciaran wept at
such honour being shown to him, and said: “Your monastery belongs to
none but God, who has given you great love beyond us all.'’

They then entered into a spiritual covenant, and as Ciaran proceeded on
his way, Columkille composed the quatrain :—

“ Noble the youth who goes westward from us
Oiaran, the son of the carpenter ;
Without envy, without pride, without contention,
Withoutjealousy, without satire.”
