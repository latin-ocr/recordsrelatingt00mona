the faith and morals of the pupils who would frequent them.
The aim of these establishments is to put asunder what God
hath joined in the formation and constitution of the human
mind. They would divide man’s individuality, and treat him
as if he had one capacity for secular knowledge and another,
quite independent, for moral and religious culture. And whilst.
they would allow, forsooth, the opportunities for religious

' instruction to those to whom—without limit——the commission

of teaching was divinely confided‚ they would not allow their
interference, much less their control, in the other departments
of education. Such a distinction would be sure to lead to the
most disastrous results. It would poison the very sources of
education‚ and under the pretence of a boon, it would be sure>
to rob us of that Faith which—throu gh God' s mercy—we have·
preserved through centuries of Ρο18001111011 and suffering. Yes,

the most prominent design and purpose of those condemned
establishments 1s to separate the people from their pastors, and
to break up that union which, despite all the efforts of earth and
hell to the contrary, has preserved amongst us, without taint or
variation, the Faith once delivered to the Saints.

You will, therefore, be consolidating and perpetuating this-
holy union, and you will be securing to your children, and your
children's children for generations to come, the blessings of a

and observances of the One Τ1110 F aith, without which it
is impossible to please God3 and of the One Τ1110 01101011, 0111
of which there 18 110 salvation.

We dc, therefore, calculate with confidence upon your
bountiful aid to proceed with a work so fraught with results of
such importance to religion amongst us. Every one can give
something, and no one will be found to say, I shall give nothing.
The result we hope for at your hands depends not on the large
contributions of the few, but rather on the small contributions
of the many At the same time, they who can give largely
will contribute according to the means with which God has
blessed them, whilst thos 80 111 humble circumstances, even to the
poor widow, will not withhold their mite. We are to recollect
that God regards not so much the hand as the heart—not so
much the amount given as the intention and good desire of
the iver.

Igfeel, however, the language of entreaty must not be used.
It is wholly unsuited to your spontaneous generosity, which
requires not to be evoked‚ but rather to be regulated in the
manner it is to be exercised. I, therefore, hope that the first
