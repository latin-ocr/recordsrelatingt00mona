St. Paul, ‘⁶ him to whom we must conform ourselves.'’ Yes, if
we wish to obtain a happy death, we must, during life, conform
>ourselves, by mortification, 111110 11116 divine model. We must
not seek after the gratification of our senses—no; we must seek
after “ the mortification of the flesh, and carry it always about
us.”—2 Cor. iv. 10. Τ116 Apostle does not tell us simply 10
carry 1116 mortification of Christ about us, but that we must
always do so ; that mortificationis 10 be our constant companion,
in every place, and on every occasion. Yes, dcarest brethren,
if we wish 10 be engrafted in Christ and 10 become truly His
members‚ we must now begin 10 bear His image, which is 10 116
formed in 0111· 601116 by mortification. By the constant practice
of this virtue, we must every day be enabled more truly to say,
with the Apostle, “ Ι live, now not Ι ; 11111 Christ liveth in me.''
-Galaa ii. 21. By the continual exercise 01 11116 virtue, we
must bear a resemblance to Christ, our divine model, if we wish
one day to reign with Him in the kingdom 01 Η16 glory3 for
the Apostle says, “ Whom he foreknew‚ he also predestinated
to be made conformable 10 1116 image 01 1116 Son.’'-Rom. viii.
29. This great Apostle of nations not only impresses on all the
necessity 01 Christian mortification, but, like a faithful disciple
· of his divine Master‚ he has left us the most heroic example 01
11116 great virtue. He has shown us the necessity we are under
-01 crucifying the flesh, with its vices and concupiscences, not
only to satisfy God’s justice for the crimes we have committed,
“to fill up in ourselves those things 11161 616 wanting 01 1116
sufferings of Christ,” but also to preserve us from relapsing
into sin. His fasts and other austerities are so minutely de-
scribed in his Epistles, as scarcely to require illustration. WVas
there ever a more generous or more perfect conversion than that
of this illustrious Apostle Ρ Who retracted his sins more than
116 did Ρ Who detested and abhorred them more Ρ Who showed
a firmer resolution 01 never more abandoning the service of his
divine Master ? Did he not go so far as to bid defiance to all
the powers on earth, in hell, or 111 heaven to shake his con-
stancy Ρ And did he venture to walk in any other path except
that of mortification Ρ Does 116 himself not tell us that, as soon

as he was converted, he swore a perpetual war against flesh and
blood P—Gal. i. 16. 1)066 116 himself not declare that he kept
his body not merely in subjection and obedience‚ but likewise
in slavery and punishments Ρ “ I chastise my body, and bring
it into subjection ; lest perhaPS, when I have preached 10 0111616,
Ι myself should become a castaway.''—l Cor. ix. 26. And why
this, my brethren? What necessity had St. Paul to practise
such rigorous austerities‚ who had heard himself pronounced, by
:the oracle of Eternal Truth‚ a vessel of election? Oh, it was
