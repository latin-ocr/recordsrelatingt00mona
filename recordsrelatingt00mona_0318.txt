Comte; and day by day its influences still increases. That
‘influence is deadly beyond all example. Whatsoever it touches
it breaks to pieceS. Other systems of philosophy have been
-a revolt on the part of reason, as against religion3 Positivism
makes war 011 both religion and reason. Other philosophies
have set forth solutions of the great problem of man's destiny3
solutions, no doubt, various, false, and contradictory in them-
selves, yet each sincerely professing to be a solution. Positiv-
ism declares any attempt at a solution to be a delusion or
audacity. The existence of a personal and living God, the im-
mortal soul, free-will, saith, prayer, Providenoe, conscience, truth

We propose, in this paper, to give some account oi the

'It is the missortune of our time and position, as Irish Catho-
lics, that if we would read the current literature at all, we
must expose ourselves to the influence of writers whose

«should admit into their columns praise and recommendations
*of such works. It would be a useful undertaking, if one were
‘to set forth in plain language the various doctrines which inspire
the leading periodicals habitually read by millions. How many
would be surprised to find their favourite writer or review to be
‘in reality the apostle of·some system, subsersive not only of all
‘that the reader holds as sacred in religion, but even of the
principles upon which he unhesitatingly rests his theories of
right and duty as towards society? How many would be
astonished to learn that the scientific, or poetioal, or tenderly
emotional writing concerning God, upon which their simple
‘piety is wont to rest with delight, is nothing else than a roun-

The first place in our notice is due to Auguste Oomte, the
founder of the Positivist philosophy and religion. The sources
whence we have drawn our information are eminently favour-
able to him, seeing that they are the writings of those who
