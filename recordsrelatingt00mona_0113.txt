sSynod that the diocese of Feara-Midhe was (livided into two
parts, between the Bishop of Clonmacnoise and the Bishop of
Olonard‚ ἤιε-110111 Clochan-an-imrin westwards to the Bishop
of Clonmacnoise, and from the same Olochan, eastwards, to the

Bishop of Clonard. This Abbot died in 1124. The Cloghan‚

[GILLACHRIST UA MAELEOEN

vsucceeded. He is styled by the Four Masters as “ fountain of

knowledge and charity, head of the prosperity and affiuence of
Erin.'' He died in 1127.

DOMHNALL O’ DUBHAI

succeeded. Lynch expressly states in his MS. History that he
was Bishop of Olonmacnoise, and Archbishop of Connaught at
the same time. WVare thinks there must be some mistake (al-
though he places him amongst the successors of St. Kieran),
for it appeared to him that the two offices could not be united
in the same person and at the same time. There is nothing
incompatible in supposing that he was Administrator of the
WVest, and Bishop of Clonmacnoise at the same time. He is
stylecl by the F our Masters as ‘⁶ head of the wisdom and hospi·
tality of the province.'' He died after celebrating Mass in
Clonfert, in 1136. Tuam was not made an Archdiocese until

the Synod of Kells was held.

MORIERTACH O'MELIDER

succeeded. According to Lynch’s MS. History, he was Bishop,
not only of Olonmacnoise, but also of WVestern Meath and
Clonfert. He attended the Synod at Kells, held by Cardinal
John Paro, in 1152. He was styled “vir sapiens et scriba
etcaput religionis.'’ He lived to the advanced age of ninetv
years, fifty of which elapsed after his elevation to the priest-
hood, and forty after his consecration as bishop. He died in
the year 1187, or 1188, or 1189, according to different
authorities. It appears certain that he resigned his See some
years before his death.

TIGERNACH O'MAELEOIN (DOMINIOK O'MALONE)
. succeeded. He died in 1172.

MU1REAOH O’MURREOHAN

>succeeded. He had the reputation of a man of learning. He
. seems to be the same prelate with one whom some call Muriertach
