FUNERAL or THE Mos'r Rssv. Da. KILDUFF.
Loanord, Momlay Niylzt.

On this day, all that was mortal of the Most Rev. Dr.
Kssduff, Lord Bishop of Ardagh, was consigned to the tomb-⁴
beneath the sanctuary of the noble cathedral to this town.
attended by everything that could bear testimony of the«
affectionate veneration in which the illustrious prelate was-
held by rich and poor. WVhen the sad intelligence of the
demise of the good bishop became known on the afternoon
of Friday, the greatest sorrow prevailed among persons
of every class and creed in this town. All busines ss may be
said to have been suspended here, and a stranger passing-
through the general bustling and busy streets would be inclined
to believe that all the inhabitants had left their homes, which
they had closed at the time of their leaving, and had not up to
now returned. During Saturday, the people who flocked in
from every direction, proceeded in groups to the cathedral to
offer up their prayers to the throne of grace for the everlasting
rest of 0110 who was treasured in the hearts 01 1118 flock, and
who was to them a father, friend, and guide. Growds 01 1110
poor and needy expressed their deep sorrow for his loss, with
bitter tears and wailing, and the voice 01 grief was to be heard

all that was noble and exalted was his, in beart and soul, that
raised him to the highest elevation 01 1111111011 goodness, made his-
entire life a blessing--an honour 10 1118 illustrious order and
race, and his death a calamity deeply to be deplored. Since I
arrived here, persons in every spbere speak on no other subject
than the virtues 01 1110 good bishop, whose boundless charity
and great and inexhaustible benevolence are only now made pro-
minently known by the wretched, whom he relieved and
sustained by his private generosity. Like his 11Ιο8101, “ 110
went about doing good,'’ and from 1118 slender means he gave·
freely and in secret to those on whom poverty and privation
pressed with a heavy hand. Like the flower that gives out its
sweetest perfume when crushed in the dust, the warm-hearted'
charity 01 1110 good prelate did not become fully known until²
he was stricken by death in the midst 01 his peaceful victories
for Christ, and for the promotion 01 1110 temporal and endearing
happiness 01 1118 faithful people. Whatever he determined on
doing he accomplished, because he was always in 00111081, andi
