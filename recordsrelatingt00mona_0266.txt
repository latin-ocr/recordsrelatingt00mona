Dearly Beloved Brethren in Christ,

It becomes our pleasing duty to have promulgated the
Encyclical letter of our Holy Father‚ Pope Pius IX„ dated the
8th of December of last year, and addressed to all the bishops
of the Catholic Church throughout the world. The EncyclicaL.
though addressed to bishops only, will be explained by our
beloved clergy to their faithful flocks ; for the voice of the Pope

her irreconcilable hatred to every species of error, no matter how
masked by false theology, false philosophy, false politics, or any
other garb by which the spirit of salsehood seeks to deceive poor
souls and plunge them into perdition. As might be expected,
this great act of the Holy Father has aroused the indignation of
infidels, revolutionists, and heretics3 it has produced amongst
those turbulent men a commotion like to the raging of a tem-
pestuous sea. They see that their wicked designs have been
unmasked, their insidious plots revealed, and their perverse
principles condemned, whilst, at the same time, the truth that
