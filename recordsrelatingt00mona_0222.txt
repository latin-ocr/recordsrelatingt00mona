to be an increased expense, to Paris for education rather than
going to Maynooth Ρ Ι cannot answer for the individual
motives of those persons3 but Ι think it may be presumed that-
some go to acquire a knowledge of the French language‚ which
they could not so perfectly acquire in Ireland3 others may be
desirous of seeing strange countries‚ and they may have other
motives of which Ι 3111 not aware. ·

Are the majority of the inmates of the Irish College at Paris*
in priest's orders Ρ When a student becomes a priest he is
obliged after a very short time to leave the college; because
the nature of the establishment excludes priests; but there may
be many in deacon's orders.

Is the rule of discipline in general as strict in the Irish College
in Paris as it is at Maynooth Ρ Ι am not perfectly acquainted
with the system of discipline at Maynooth3 but as far as Ι have>
been able to observe Ι think they are pretty much the same.

Is the difficulty of going forth from the college as greatin

Co e e. ’ ,

ᾪὲᾘο appoints the President of the College Ρ The President
receives his ultimate appointment from the King of F rance.

Who recommends him in the first instance Ρ Ι 3111 not
aware what recommendation any President has received to be*
a ointed.

ppIs there no rule that his appointment is to commence with
any person other than the King of France? If the King of
France wishes to act absolutely, he might appoint to the Presi-
dency of the College an Irish ecclesiastic that he may judge fit
for the situation3 but it is my belief that he does not appoint
anyone who is not recommended by some clerical authority in
