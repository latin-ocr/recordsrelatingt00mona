their rescue. However, as the bishop was far advanced in years,
and very feeble, Shane allowed him to take up his abode in the·
house of a· Catholic nobleman living in the neighbourhood, who
pledged his honour that the prelate would present himself to the-
English authorities in Dublin at the close of the winter. The
bishop was faithful ,to his engagement; for he set out for the-
.metropolis about the end of March, and on his arrival was.
thrown into prison, where he remained till the summer of 1602,
when his friends effected his enlargement by paying a heavy

fine'“As to the other prisoners, among whom was my friend

Father Bernard Moriarty, they were sent under a strong escort
to Dublin ; but no sooner had they reached the neighbourhood
of Multifernan than they were met by Walter N ugent, standard-
bearer to the Baron of Delvin‚ who commanded a company of
thirty soldiers in the Queen's pay. This valiant young officer
demanded the release of the prisoners; but when that was re-
fused he and his men attacked the escort, and eventually suc—
ceeded in liberating the friars. Unfortunately, however, two
other companies of the Queen's troops, on hearing the musketry,
came speedily to the scene of action, and overpowered Walter
Nugent's detachment, six of whom lost their lives in the
skirmish. The friars were then sent on to the prison of Dublin
Oastle. As for my friend Moriarty‚ he received a gun-shot
wound which fractured both his thighs ; and after lingering a
short time in intense agony in a dungeon‚ where they refused
'him bed, medical attendance, or any other comfort, he finally
surrendered his pure soul to God, and was buried in the
cemetery of St. J ames, outside the city wall. Thus terminated
the career of this venerable priest, who, in my opinion, deserves
to be styled a martyr.'’
