account of restorations made by them, which circumstances had

rendered necessary or 11861111. See Petrie, pp. 392 and 393.
The Registry 01 Clonmacnoise ascribes its erection to F ergal

O'Rorke, King 01 Connaught, about the middle 01 1116 1611111

cenTfiirs tower is constructed 01 6 fine sandstone‚ and its masonry

is laid in regular courses, except about twenty 1661 01 1116 upper
portion, which is 01 006186 masonry 01 11116168866 111116810116, 6116
which, like the upper part 01 1116 round tower 01 Τ111161161111, 111
1116 County 01 Kilkenny, and some others, is evidently the work
01 6 16161 period than the lower part. It rests, as usual, on a
projecting circular plinth, and measures fifty-six feet in circum-
16161106 61 118 base. Its present height is but sixty-two 1661, 111
addition to which we must allow about seventeen 1661 101 1116
00111061 1001, which 18 now wanting3 but there 18 110 reason to
doubt that it was originally one 01 the highest 01 118 kind in
Ireland; 101, 68 Ι have already remarked‚ it was obviously not
restored to its original altitude when the present upper portion
was re·erected. The wall is three 1661 111116 inches in thickness.
The interior exhibits rests 101 10111 storeys, including that on a
level with the doorway, and beneath which there was a fifth
storey, not lighted. The second and third storeys are each
lighted by a single quadrangular aperture, and the upper storey,
as in the Tower 01 Tullaherin, contains eight openings 01 1116
861116 101111. The doorway is five 1661 three inches in height,
two feet three inches in width immediately under the impostS,
and two 1661 six inches at the sill. The keystone and those
forming the imposts extend the entire thickness 01 1116 wall, as
does the sill-stone also, which is five 1661 111 length. Some say
a church was attached to this tower. There are, however, no
remains 01 11 61 present.

Here I may, perhaps, fittingly reproduce Petrie's conclusions
regarding the origin and uses 01 1116 Irish Round Towers :—

I. That the towers are 01 Christian and ecclesiastica] origin,
and were erected at various periods between the fifth and thir-
teenth centuries.

II. That they were designed to answer at least a twofold
use, namely, to serve <as belfries and as keeps 01 places 01 strength,
in which the sacred utensils‚ books, 161108, 6116 011161 valuables
were deposited, and into which the ecclesiastics to whom they
belonkged could retire 101 security in cases 01 sudden predatory
61160 . ⁷
III. That they were probably also used, when occasion re-
quired, as beacons and watch-towers.

Several eminent writers, such as Ledwich, Molyneux, Pin-
kerton, Montmorenci‚ and Sir Walter Scott‚ advocated these
