The second church is called.
TEMPLE-RI, OR O’MELAGLIN’S OHUROH,

rand it lies immediately to the south-east 01 the cathedral, and
has the round tower called M‘Carthy's Tower lying on its north
side -2'.e. between it and Athlone. This is the oldest church of
the group‚ it having been unquestionably erected before the
introduction of the pointed or Gothic style into this country.
Archdall is 01 opinion that it was erected at the expense 01·
F lann Sionna, King of Meath, and he places the date of its
erection in 909, and& thus it is called Temple· Ri.

“9.09 —In this year Flann Sionna, King of Meath, and
Abbot Colman MacAillealla founded a 011111011 of stone lame,
which was called the Church of the Kings

M1. O' Donovan thinks, notwithstanding Petrie' s opinion to
the contrary, that this is O'Melaghlin's Church.

TEMPLE-KELLY

is the third church, and it lies east and by north of the cathedral,
and is now level with the ground. This was the mausoleum of

the O’Kellys of Hy-Many. According to Archdall, Oonnor
O'Kelly and the Hy-Many sept erected a church here, in the
..dead of the Hospital, in the year 1167.

TEMPLE-KIERAN

is the fourth church, and it lies immediately to the east 01 the
¹site 01 Temple-Kelly. It is a very small church.

TEMPLE-DOWLING, ΟΒ HURPAN,

is the fifth church, and is the most modern of the group, and
lies south of the cathedral. It was rebuilt in the seventeenth
century, and in Archdall's time was used as the Protestant
church of the parish.

TEMPLE-FIN N IAN ‚ ΟΒ FIN N EEN ,

is the sixth church. It lies to the north 01 the cathedral,
and at the boundary wall which encloses the cemetery. The
smaller round tower is attached to it, which some writers ’
3357 was ereoted by Fingin MacCarthy, Prince of Desmond.
The following passages, taken from the Four Masters, seem
to negative this statement :—“ German, who had spent one
year over Tobar-Fingin‚ died on his pilgrimage, at Olon-
macnoise, A.D. 610.” The well of Fingin is still in existence,

rand near this tower. It is thought this well, church, 31ὲᾶ tower
