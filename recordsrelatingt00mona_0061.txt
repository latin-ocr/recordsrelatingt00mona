CLONMACNOISE, OR THE SEVEN CHURCHES. 41.

though 01 Ulster extraction, was born in Westmeath, in the year
507. But Eugene O'Curry and Archdall‚ whose opinion Ι prefer,
declare him to have been born in Roscommon‚ A.D. 516. He
was the son 01 Boetius and Darercha. He was also called
Macantsoir, or the son 01 1110 carpenter. He was educated at
the great College 01 Clonard‚ which was presided over, at that
time, by St. F innian, who in his day shone as the sun 01 our
educational horizon. Having finished his educational course
there, he went to the monastery 01 St. Nennidius, in one 01 1110
islands 01 Lough Erne. He afterwards repaired to the island 01
Arran on the coast 01 Clare, where he placed himself under the
guidance 01 St. Enda, whose 11110 was at that time considered the
most rigorous in Ireland.

Here he perfected himself in the knowledge and spirit 01
monastic rule and discipline, together with their observance.

After some time he returned to Westmeath, the county 01
1115 collegiate education. Here he was presented by a friendly
chieftain with a spot 01 ground to build a church upon. The
place was, however, low, and hence the church was afterwards
known by the name 01 “ Ο101011’5 low place,'’ or “ Isael Chiarain.’'
After some time he handed over the government 01 11115 church
10 0110 01 his tried and trusted discipleS, and he retired 101 pur-
poses 01 greater solitude into the island 01 Inisaingin, in Lough
Ree. Here 110 founded a monastery and built a church. The
temporal as well as the spiritual wants 01 1110 poor were amongst
the noble obj ects contemplated by this great man in its founda-

 

March‚ and was baptized by the Deacon J ustus, who was famed for sanctity.
Our saint was subsequently entrusted to the care of this holy man, who was
trained at the same time in the paths of piety, and in the rudiments of human
science. It is mentioned as an instance of the special favours bestowed by
Providence on Ciaran‚ that when guarding the herds 01 his tutor at Fidharta
(110, Fuerty, Co. Roscommon)‚ he heard all the instructions imparted by his
holy tutor to his fellow-students at Magh-Ai. It is also mentioned that
robbers came at one time from Ui-Failghe, to lay waste the Cenel-Fiachiadh.
Finding St.. Ciaran reading, they endeavoured to carry off the cattle which he
tended, “ but they were stricken with blindness, and were unable to move hand
or foot until they had done penance, and were released through the power of
God and the prayers of Oiaran.” After some time our saint was placed mider
the care of St. Finnian, 01 Clonard; and so great was the fame of his sanctity,
that he was soon reckoned one of the brightest ornaments of that school of
saints. There was a stag at the monastery, and Ciaran, When meclitating,
used to rest his book on the stag’s horus. One day as he thus meditated,
the bell summoned him to other duties, and as he at once arose 10 obey its
summons, the stag started away carrying off the book on his antlers. Next
morning when Ciaran arose he found the stag awaiting him, and though the
preceding day and night were wet and the book was open, not a letter in it
was found to be damaged, through the merits of the saint. YVhen St.
Ninnedh, from Loch Erne, went to the school 01 Finnian‚ this holy master
told him to ask some of the students for a copy of the Gospels, that he
might study them.

Ninnedh went around to several but could procure a book from none.
