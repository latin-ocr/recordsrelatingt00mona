MINUTES OF EVIDENCE. 207

The Tithes' Agitation was a burning question in Dr.
‘O'Higgins' time. He took an active part in it. His views and

those of the Ardagh Clergy, regarding it are partially ex-
pressed in the following resolutions and memorial, which were

drawn up by the bishop himself :—

Resolved :--“ That the paying of tithes, as they are now
appropriated in Ireland‚ being contrary to reason and religion,
it is the imperative duty of every sincere Christian to suffer any
persecution—even death itself——rather than willingly acquiesce
in their payment.''

Resolved :—“ That any landed proprietor who may be so
iniquitous and mean as to assist in the exacting of tithes from
his own impoverished tenantry‚ must be held in abhorrence and
contempt by every man of independence or principle.”

Resolved :—-“ That the people of Ireland have established a
lasting claim to the gratitude of the Protestant Bishops and
Parsons, by merely ceasz'ny to pay tithes, and thus generously
resigning their natural and undeniable right to compensation

for past rapine.”

Resolved:—“That Daniel O'Oonnell, whom we look upon
as the greatest and best man in the civilized world, continues
to command our unbounded admiration, and to enj oy our fullest
-confidence ; and that we shall always be prepared to support
him—despite his unjust opponents‚ be they who they may—with
our purses and all our energies, in his glorious pursuit of liberty
and justice for Ireland.’'

'To the Right Honourable and Honourable the Knights, Bur-
gesses, and Citizens of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled, the Petition

of the inhabitants of the Parish of Shrule, in the County
of Longford,

Most Humbly Showeth :—That‚ in common with their
fellow-countrymen, your petitioners feel themselves deeply
injured and degraded by the baneful operation of that un·
Christian impost called Tithes. That the levying taxes both
on the property and on the industry of a populous and im-
poverished nation, for the unnatural purpose of maintaining a
few useless persons in luxury, and furnishing them the means
of calumniating the religion of the many, as the Irish Parsons
generally do, is in the opinion of your petitioners contrary to
reason and Christianity3 and cannot, therefore, be made by any
human enactments binding on the consoiences of Christians.
That, consequently, your petitioners feel a religious abhorrence
for the direct or indirect payment of Tithes ; and most humbly,
