it is there that all hearts, united by charity, lay down at the
foot of the altars the tribute of their love and gratitude.

“ It was, gentlemen, with the same enthusiasm and cere·
monial that Ι have been received in all the parishes of the Island
of St. Lucia. J udge, then, what consolation and happiness I enj oy-

“ I take pleasure in stating here, that the progress which the
blacks have made in the fulfilment of their religione duties is as.
real as it is important. It is but a short time since the inhabi-
tants of St. Lucia had only three priests, and a few churches in
ruins. Now, eleven Missionaries labour there with fruit for the
salvation of their brethren; nine churches in good condition,
of which several are new, large, substantial, and very clean,
arise in different places. Every day our holy religion extends*
itself, and is consolidated in this lovely country.

“ It is the same with Grenada. In 1841, at the time of my
pastoral visit to that island, the inhabitants of St. George’s had,
as yet, only one chapel, out of repair; but their faith and
piety were such, that nothing could prevent them from attending-
at the holy mysteries. Thus, every Sunday and holiday, two-
or three thousand faithful were seen attending in deep recollec-
tion, until the end of the divine service, although they were
exposed to the rays of the burning tropical sun, or to torrents
of rain, which fall there frequently. N evertheless, desiring to
see arise in the middle of their town a large and handsome
church, more worthy of the maj esty of God, they made
numerous sacrifices and prodigious efforts to erect the fine
monument which we there admire at the present day.

“ All, without distinction, wished to work at it with their
own hands. It was not without admiration that we saw the
rich and poor, the masters and servants, carrying to the site of
the new sanctuary, stones, sand, and lime. Blacks, living seven
miles away, arrived before dawn, bringing with them their
food for the whole day ; they worked in the quarry with a
courage and strength which religion alone can give. ·

“ The place to which they had to go for the stone and lime
was a mountain so steep, that even those who had no burden‚
ascended and descended it only with the greatest difficulty3 yet,
{J'assssffiassefiiffiteffiffiSZ'ssvsssslffs'. WSZ‘Z tffiss} tissssrssarssiffi}
struck me, was a poor blind woman, more than seventy years
old, who, led by the hand of one of her granddaughters, was.
working like the others, and carrying also a stone on her head·,
a smile was on her lips and J‘oy shone on her countenance.

“ This island furnished many similar examples. But it was-
particularly at Sauterre and at the Ray that our faithful did·
wonders. For a long while they prayed their dearly beloved.
