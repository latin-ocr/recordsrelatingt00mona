and Killoon, or the Church 01 the Graves. It was called Artibra
too, that is 01 “ the Wells.” The holy wells are stffl to be seen,
bearing the names 01 St. Kieran and St. Finnian. In the later
annals, however, it is usually written Cluainmicnois. Now
Oluainmicnois, according to Seward and others, signifies the
“ Retreat 01 the 80118 01 the N obles.'' This name it received in
their opinion either because the nobles retired to it in their old
age, to spend the remainder 01 their days in peace and solitude3
or because it was a burying-place for most 01 the Irish kings
and chieftains. J oyce, however, holds a different opinion. He
maintains that it signifies the meadow 01 the Son 01 N os. In
the original name the last two syllables are in the genitive sin-
gular and not in the genitive plural, and must therefore be taken
to mean the name 01 3 person. J oyce claims the Four Masters
as supporters 01 this view. Under the year 1461 they call this
place Cluain-mue-nois-mic—Fiadhaigh. From this it would ap-
pear Nos was the 8011 01 Fiadhaigh, who was chief 01 3 tribe in
that part 01 Κ1118’8 00., and that Clonmacnoise was within his
territory. J oyce also quotes Colgan and a still higher and older
authority than any yet cited, namely, the Cartsruhe Μ8. 01 Ζο1188,
to support this view 01 the origin and meaning 01 the name.
Whatever may be said 101· 01· against either 01 these opinions,
there is no controversy about the name 01 the founder 01 this old
Abbey 01 811011 amazing splendour, wealth, and learning. Ciaran
was the name. He was called St. Ciaran the younger, to dis-
tinguish him from another great and holy man bearing the
same name—Ciaran 01 831801· Ossory. Oiaran the younger was
01 northern extraction. His father, who was a carpenter by
trade, but 01 noble bz'rz‘lz, left Ulster and settled 111 Μ3811 Ai, in
the County Roscommon. Here Ciaran was born in the year 516.

Latin, in the Codex salmanticensis, at Brussels; and in the so-called Liber
Kilkenniensis, in Marsh’s Library, Dublin. His father was Beoit, who,

Latharna. of Maghmolt, of Uladh 3 and the pious Darerca (daughter of Ercan,
son of Buachill), was our saint's mother. She was one of the Glasraidhe

the eldest. Donnan, C iaran, Odran, and Cronan. The last-named was 3

the people with intolerable burdens. Beoit sought 3 refuge from his exaetions

of Lughaid Dall. There St. Ciaran was born, on the sixth of the Kalends of
