APPENfflx. 393

This sacred place has from those days to the present re-
mained a ruin. The surviving relatives of the kings, princeS,
chieftains‚ and other great families who built mortuary chapels
here, and established perpetual Masses for themselves and their
posterity, were and are deprived by the law of all these rights.
It is unlawful, as the law now is, to roos any of these churches
by public or private subscription, even by those whose ancestors
built them. This is a grievance for the removal of which the
Catholics of Ireland‚ especially the upper classes, should
strongly agitate as well as for their other grievances. In
conclusion Ι will add, that this sacred place is one of the few
valuable inheritances that have come down to us from the past
(applause). It is like an heirloom in a family. It is a relic of
our former greatness. It should be to us as a most highly-prized
painting of a dear departed friend. It should be as the title
deeds to a great estate of Which we have been wrongfully de-
prived, and to which· we expect one day to come back as
rightful owners. As such we should carefully look after it.
I now conclude with a quotation from Dr. Johnson, written by
him a century ago, amidst the ruins of Iona, in the Hebrides,
Scotland. He said, “Far from me and from my friends be
suoh frig-id philosophy as may conduct us indifferent and
unmoved over any ground which has been dignified by wisdom,
bravery‚ or virtue. That man is little to be envied whose
patriotism would not gain force on the plain of Marathon, and
whose piety would not grow warmer amidst the ruins of Iona.”
'This beautiful sentence may thus be paraphrased. “ I pity the
Irishman whose patriotism is not increased by reading the brave
deeds of his ancestors on the plains of Olontarf or the hills near
Aughrim, and whose piety does not become more fervent and
practica] by a visit to the ruins of Glonmacnoise '’ (cheers).

The President, Mr. O'Byrne, delivered a most able and
instructive historioal address, suitable to the occasion, and
vbreathing throughout a truly noble, Catholic, and Celtic spirit.
It was greatly and justly admired.

On the motion of the Rev. J ames Madden, P.P., Lusmagh,
a warm vote of thanks was accorded the Rev. Ohairman‚ and
the proceedings then terminated.

The spectacle of'that day will long be remembered by those
who witnessed it.
