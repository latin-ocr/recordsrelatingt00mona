‘My DEAR DR. McCABE,—

Although Ι was morally certain that you were destined
to succeed our dear late Dr. Kilduff3 still, I was under some
-apprehension that your own humility or usefulness in the Con-
,gregation would stand in the way, but now Ι rejoice that God's
will has been made known, and that your Lordship’s elevation
will be hailed with gladness throughout the Ohurch, and will
confer upon the faithful of Ardagh a great blessing. Wishing
you and yours a merry Christmas and a happy N ew Year,

Ι remam, my dear Lord,

Ever faithfully yours,
ᾧ J OHN BRADY.

Rt. Rev. Dr. McOabe.

7ΜΥ DEAR Low),

I am glad to be- furnished with this opportunity of con-
gratulating your Lordship, or rather the Diocese of Ardagh‚ on
>your well merited and deserved promotion to that See. I can
assure you, there is not a prelate in Ireland to whom the news
of your appointment could give more heartfelt pleasure than it
>did to me. Indeed, on the very day the sad account of the
lamented death of my dear friend, your predecessor, reached
Rome, in common with some other prelates I fervently prayed
<you would be his successor. Thank God it is so, and you
will allow the least worthy of the Irish Prelacy to give you a
hearty welcome to our ranks. .

Wishing your Lordship many a return of the N ew Year‚
and praying God to grant you all the graces of your state,

Ι remain, my dear Lord,
Your devoted brother,

>P J. MAcEVILLY.
VMost Rev. Dr. MacCabe.
