62 mocnsn or Annum,

MacOoghlan went, and there obtained his pardon and letters
patent to his patrimonial estate or inheritance, and Delvin
Eathra became tributary to the king.

The last descendant of this ancient sept who held any posi-
tion similar to that of his great ancestors was Thomas Goghlan,
commonly called “the Maw.’' He died without issue in the
year 17 90. He represented the King’s Oounty for several years
in the Irish Parliament. Colonel de Montmorency thus de-
scribes him .——“ Thomas Golgan, Esq.‚ ‘the Maw‚’ that is,
Mac, for he was not known in his own territory by any other
appellation, was a remarkably handsome man, gallant, eccentric,
proud, satirical, hospitable in the extreme, and of expensive
habits. In disdain of modern times, he adhered to the national
customs of Ireland and the modes of living practised by his
ancestors. His house was ever open to strangers3 his tenants
held their lands at will, and paid their rents according to the
ancient fashion, partly in kind and the remainder in money.
The Maw levied the fines of mortmain when a vassal died. He
became heir to the defunct sarmer, and no law was admissible
or practised within the precincts of MacCoghlan's domain but
such as savoured of the Brehon code. It must be observed,
however, that most commonly the Maw's commands‚ enforced
by the impressive application of his horsewhip, instantly decided
a litigated point. With him perished the rude grandeur of his
long-drawn line. His vast estates passed to the son of his sister,
the late Right Hon. Bowes Daly, of Dalystown, Co. Galway,
who likewise had no children, and who, shortly before his death
in 1821, sold the MacOoghlan estate to divers persons.

Many of his days were passed in the pleasant towns of
Banagher and Ologhan, in the neighbourhood of which so
many of MacOoghlan’s celebrated castles and strongholds are
still to be seen.
