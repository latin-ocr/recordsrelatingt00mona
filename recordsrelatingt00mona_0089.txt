CLoNMACNfflsE, 00 THE SEvEN CHURCHES. 69

In 1087, Archdall, citing MacGreoghegan, records, “that the
Abbot Connor MacOonnamaboght did purchasesor ever I selcieran,
or the hospital 01 St. Kieran, from Donnell MacFloyn O'Melaghlin‚
King 01 Μο0111.” Β111 O'Donovan thinks that Isel-Ohiaran was
a tract 01 low-lying country which belonged to Clonmacnoise.
It is difficult to understand what could have been the meaning
01 the abbot purchasing the hospital 01 Clonmacnoise from the
king. According to Archdall‚ citing MacGeoghegan‚ O'Kelly’s
Ohurch occupied the site 01 Isel-Chiaran; but O’Donovan thinks
this is one 01 Archdall's blunders, and that what MacGreoghegan
meant was to convey that the lands 01 Isil-Ohiaran—or the
hospital lands—belonged to Clonmacnoise.

At the years 1135 and 1205, Four Masters, reference is made
to the fort qf the abbot. This is, probably, the 1011 within which
the old castle 01 Olonmacnoise stands, and may have been De
Lacy’s Osa-stle. On Easter Monday in this year, zze. 1135, the town
01 Clonmacnoise, with the Churoh 01 Moriegh O’Duffie and the
place called Lisean Abbey, were both consumed by an accidental
fire.—MacGreoghegan.

Archdall states, on the authority 01 1110 Annals 011110 Island
01 All Saints, that a castle was erected by the English at Olon-
macnoise, in 1214. This castle is now 10 110 80011 111 1111118 within
a kind 01 dun or rath. Reference 18 1110ᾶο by the Four Masters
to (ι ecczcsezmy 110111 1110 yarden 01 1110 Abbess, which was made by
the Abbot Breasal Oonailla, as 101 08 1110 Oarn 01 the three crosses,
A.D. 1024. Devorgilla, the daughter 01 Moroght O'Melaghlin,
King 01 Meath, and wife 01 Τ10111011 O'Rorlze,* repaired the
church 01 1110 nunnery 01 Olonmacnoise, A.D. lma—Mao-
Greoghegan. And, in 1180, the same church 01 1110 nunnery was
consumed by fire, accidentally. The houses adj oining were also
destroyed by the same cause. The causeway 0011 81111 110 traced,
and the nunnery 118011 1108 110011 dug out 01 1110 mound which
covered and concealed it until Rev. Mr. Graves, in the summer
01 1865, by aid 01 subscriptions, employed some workmen to
make excavations, which resulted in the restoration 01 1110 1011011
011011, arch, and door 01 11118 church3 re-erected in 1167. St.
Griollan had founded this nunnery centuries before.

*Tiernan O‘Rorke, Lord of Breffni and Conmacne, a man of great power
for a long time, was treacherously 810111 by Hugo de Lacy and Donnell, the 8011

wife, was the immediate cause of the invasion of Ireland. She died in the
Monastery of Drogheda, A.D. 1193, at the age of ninety-five. She was in her
sixty-fourth year at her husband’s death, and in her forty·fourth when she

eloped with Dermot, King of Leinster, in 1152, who was then in 1118 sixty-second
