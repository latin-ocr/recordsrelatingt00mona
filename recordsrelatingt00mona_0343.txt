ford, the successful pastor of the Church at &Vaterburffi and
to·day in their own city he presides over the Diocese of Provi-
dence, as its worthy and beloved first bishop.

Bishop O'Reilly was a man of great piety and activity. No
matter how wearied he might return from his travels, he never
retired to rest without having recited the Rosary of the Blessed
Virgin. He was an assiduous student, and rarely went to bed
before midnight, so attached was he to his books. He arose at
five o’clock in the morning, generally the first of the household,
and was wont to ring the bell himself that summoned his clergy
to prayer.

In behalf of his diocese he paid a visit to Europe, in Decem-
ber, 1855, his object being to procure a body of religious men
to take charge of the children. He visited his aged parents in
Ireland‚ and on the 23rd of J anuary he sailed in the ill-fated
Paczflc for America. The sad story of her loss is known to many.
Uncertainty at first prevailed, doubt soon changed to sear, and
at last the dread sear was realised, and the See of Hartford
mourned her bishop, to whom the sea gave a grave, and the
storm winds sang a requiem. Providence and Hartford mourned
his loss, and in both of the afflicted cities solemn Masses were
sung for the repose of his soul, in the presence of numerous
bishops and priests, and a large gathering of the laity. The
sad manner of his death served to increase their grief, and to
lend greater solemnity to the occasion. At Providence, Arch-
bishop Hughes, of N ew York, pronounced an eloquent panegyric
upon the virtues and labours of the lamented dead*

were Peter Monahan and Mary (ozee Skelly) Monahan. Their
ancestors had resided in that neighbourhood for centuries before.

* His brother, William, and the Very Rev. Dr. Hughes, his nephew, attracted
by his good example and holy life, followed him to America ; both were raised
to the dignity of .Vicars-General in the diocese in due course. The Rev.
B. O. R. Sheridan, and three other nephews are also labouring With great zeal
in Hartford, and the Rev. Thomas O’Reilly, C.C.‚ another nephew‚ is a most
