. ›enrolled'a poor and humble disciple 01 St. Francis. If, there-
1010, you deem me worthy 01 511011 311 honour permit me this
’111513111 to take my profession-³

“ ‘ What 1 ' said the venerable bishop, 110111 whose aged eyes
vthe 10315 51103111οἃ fast and hot, ‘ are you prepared to renounce
your liberty 101 the poor habit 01 0111 order? do you consent to
101080 1110 enjoyments 01 3 secular career 101 3 1110 01 penance
and mortification Ρ Ῡο11 told us that the man into whose power
we have fallen has promised you much, provided you would
divest yourself 01 1110 1131111, 311(1 betake you to your old pro-
10551011 01 311115. Ρο11(101, therefore, what you should do, lest
perhaps, you might one day repent your precipitancy.'

“ ‘ Most reverend father,’ Ι replied‚ ‘ nothing can shake or
alter my firm resolution. Ι have long yearned 101 this day3
and 11 11 be not presumptuous in one unlettered as 1 am to make
the reflection, Ι would humbly submit that all the calamities
which have overtaken us 01 1310 should be regarded as 50 many
stumbling-blocks cast by Satan across my path, to divert me
’110111 the goal 101 which Ι have been struggling.'

“ ‘ Enough, enough,’ replied the bishop, ‘ your desire shall
be satisfied, and may heaven help you on the rugged road you
Thave chosen! '

“ I then threw myself on my knees at the provincial's 1001,
and in the dim light 01 1110 prison chamber made my profession,
-and was duly received into the Order 01 St. Francis. Never,
never shall I 101801 1110 joy Ι 1011 011 11131 day ; never while Ι
live shall the recollection 01 11131 110111 13ᾰο 110111 my memory‚
Oountless are the splendid 111110110115 Ι have witnessed since then,
here in Louvain, in Brussels 3 but I doubt 11111011 11 any 01 them
-all could equal the solemn rite 01 my profession in Loughshodie.
Realize it to your imagination, dear brother; picture to your-
5011 3 young man in the plenitude 01 1115 strength, kneeling at
the 1001 01 311 38οἃ bishop and his provincial, both captives 101
111011 loyalty to God and the 1311311 01 their fathers3 and there
in the gloom 01 11131 (1111180011, pronouncing with unfaltering
tongue those irrevocable vows which consecrated him the 11080
⁴servant 01 God, and doomed him to the persecution 01 1111111055
laws.

“ The recollection 01 11131 crowning moment 01 my 1110 1135
