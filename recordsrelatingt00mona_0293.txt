DR. Klnnusr. 273

· Although his success in hae materia has been very considerable
and satisfactory, something more remains to be done. He was
ZfiffaffivffiteflgitifffiifffissrsstssKssssgffidffl?{fissssumirff2333}
appo'inted Canon in August, 1879, being introduced into the
Prebenda . . . . quam Rev. Presbyter Edvardus Mc
Graver Parochus de Granard obtinebat.

In 1881 he was promoted to the Benefice of Street, County
WVestmeath, where he is still. Canon Hoare is considered a
priest of very high principles and practice.

The Very Rev. J ames O'Farrell succeeded him as President
of St. Mel's. He was born in the Townland of Ahara, Parish of
Legan, Oounty Longford, in the year 1847. He was one of
the first boarders in St. Mel's, after its opening in 1865. Having
finished his intermediate course there, in 1867, he entered St.
Patrick's Oollege, Maynooth, in August of that same year.
In both these Colleges he obtained PREMIUMS 3 and was ordained
Priest, by the Right Rev. Dr. Oonroy, on the F east of the
Patronage of St. J oseph, 011 the 21st April, 1872. On the 2nd
May, same year, he was appointed Professor at St. Mers, and
entered 011 his duties next day, which he continued to discharge
with much zeal and energy until 3rd April, 1875, when he was
appointed OG. of Granard. There ’ 116 remained until J uly,
1876, when he was translated to the Curacy of Banagher, King's
County. In 1881, he was promoted from Banagher to the
Administratorship of the important Parish of St. Mary‚ Athlone.
In September of the same year he was promoted from St.
Mary's‚ Athlone, to his present position, as President of St.
Mel’s‚ which he so worthily holds*

Dr. Kilduff's great love for the Holy 866 was manifested on
all suitable occasions, and more especially in 1859, when Pius
IX„ of blessed memory, was assailed by wicked men, and the
dignity and independence attaching by divine right to his holy
office placed in alarming dangers.

In that crisis, the Bishop of Ardagh was one of the first
prelates in Ireland to convoke an assembly of his clergy, and
the leading members, amongst the laity, and it was unanimously
resolved at that meeting, with an enthusiam and cordiality rarely
equalled, to present an address of sympathy to his Holiness.

'¹‘ An historioal narrative, regat-(ling the foundation and completion os St.
Mel’s College‚ should, in the opinion of the compiler, include a brief sketch of
its Presidents. It is admittedly a source of regret that some accurate record
of the Parish Priests and Bishops (i. e. of all Ireland), together with the
chief events of their administration, was not kept from the beginning. Such
a record would be a most valuable document in the hands of the future
historian, whom God will, doubtless, raise up to tell the true story of Ireland in
its fulness, when the proper time comes. 1
