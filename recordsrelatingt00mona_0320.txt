only this : a conviction that the revolutionary work 01 the
eighteenth century was complete, and that the work 01 the
nineteenth century should be towards a reconstruction 01 society
on a new basis. However this may be, it was in 1822, about
four years after his first meeting with St. Simon, that Oomte
laid the foundations 01 the new philosophy, “which he called
positive, because it was the generalization 01 the method which
each positive science had employed in particular.’' (p. 388).
In that year he published his Plan des Travaux Necessaz‘res pour
Reoryaniser Za Soeiete'. In 1825 110 published in the Producam,
considerations Plzilosoplziques sur les Scz‘enees et les Samnis, and
Considerations sur Ze Nouveau Puvoir spiritual. These essays
contain an outline 01 the Positive Philosophy :—

“ There it is shown (1) that all phenomena‚ even those 01
politics‚ are subject to invariable laws ; (2) that the human
mind passes 110111 initial to theologica] conceptions to final positive
conceptions; (3) that human activity, in like manner, passes-
through indu strial re‘yr'me, through the transitional state 01 a defen-
sive military re'gyime; (4) that everywhere, and at all times, the
state 01 opinions and manners determine the institutions, and that
the nature 01 the general beliefs determines a corresponding poli-
tical scheme3 (5) that philosophy (or general beliefs) in passing
from the theological to the positive stage must bring about the
substitution 01 the industrial 101· the military reqime ; and, finally,
that the spiritual reorganisation, which is the necessary con-
dition 01 all social reorganisation‚ must repose upon the authority
01 demonstration, it must be based upon science‚ with a priest-
hood properly constituted out 01 the regenerated scientific
classes. 111 other words, the spiritual authority must issue from--
a philosophy which can be demonstrated, not from a philosophy
which is imagines] '' (pp. 389, 390.)

This year is remarkable also 101· his marriage with Caroline
Massin‚ an event which exercised a pernicious infiuence on his*
after 1110. Τ110 marriage was singularly unhappy. He abso- ‚
lutely declined all religious ceremony in contractin g it. After
years 01 vexatious quarrels, the parties separated in 1842. We⁴
may here add that, in 1845, whilst his wife was yet living, he
first met Madame Olotilde de Vaux, whose husband also was
living, but condemned to the galleys 101· 1110. Mr. Lewes-
remarks that each 01 them, though morally free, was legally
bound. “Marriage being thus impossible,’' says our author,
“ they had only the imperfect yet inestimable consolation 01 a
pure and passionate friendship.’' She died the next year.
“ The remainder 01 his life was a perpetual hymn to her memory.
Every week he visited her tomb. Every day he prayed to her,
and invoked her continual assistance ’' (p. 401).
