spiritual and corporal works of mercy. The pious faithful
endeavour, at least during Lent, to hear Mass every day. We
earnestly exhort all, whenever circumstances permit, to assist
devoutly at that adorable sacrifice—to offer up, 111 11111011 with
the priest and in atonement for their sins, the blood of our
Δ1101110101, Christ J esus, which “ cleanseth us from all iniquity.''
During this season of penance and prayer, the Church, in the
:sacred office recited by her ministers, will commemorate daily
the sufferings and death of our divine Lord. The same should
-be the subject of your frequent and pious meditations, and with
that view we strongly recommend the excellent devotion of the
Stations of the Oross. We also earnestly desire that public
evening prayers be offered up, at least 111 1110 princip al church of
each parish, at Which the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin will be
recited as usual ; in the remote rural districts it may be recited
in common by each family. Your fasts and prayers will be more
acceptable in the sight of God, and will draw down more
abundantly the 011010081 blessings of heaven When accompanied
by w orks of mercy and charity. These wmks may be practised
in various way s——visiting the sick, comforting the afflicted, 111-
structing the ignorant, bringing 1110 erring to repentance, giving
alins to the poor, 00001 (11118 10 your respective 0111111108. “Alms‚''

says holy Tobias,‘ ‘delivereth from death, and the same is that
which purgeth away sins and maketh to find mercy and life
everlasting.'’—Tob. xii. 9. Hence the Church, during the holy
season of Lent, ceases not to recommend these most meritorious
works, repeating in her office the words of the prophet Isaiah ε
“Break thy bread to the hungry, and bring the needy and
strangers into thy house 3 when thou shalt see one naked, cover
him, and despise not thine own flesh.''—Isaiah‚ lviii. 7. We
take this opportunity of most gratefully acknowledging the
generous contributions sent to us by our devoted clergy and
faithful people towards the completion of St. Mel' 8 0011080, and
we humbly pray that the good and merciful 01οᾶ may bestow
on the contributors 1118 011010081 graces and blessings. Whilst
we have 110 doubt but you will continue to take that lively
interest in our Diocesan College which it so justly claims,
permit us to observe that the utmost vigilance of the clergy is
required in watching over the religious and secular training,
and in preserving in 'their integrity the faith and morals of the
youth of both sexes 111 their respective parishes. Unceasing
efforts are made to subvert the religious principles or weaken
the piety of the rising genera-tion, chiefly by dangerous sy stems
of education. We 11οᾶ thought that 111 11118 diocese we were
comparatively free fiom the dangers and abuses arising from
the mixed system followed 111 111οΟ Νο1101101 Schools· ‚ but0 recent
