was pledged to it, and that you would all feel the reproach,
-equally as myself, 11 the passer-by could say, “ this man began
to band, but he was not able to finish.” I, therefore, decided
that the works should go on without stop or delay, and that Ι
‘was more than warranted in pledging the diocese 101 the means
01 meeting the expenses.

I am now to test whether Ι have resolved rightly or Wrongly
in this determination—whether Ι have overrated your generous
zeal, or only calculated, at a due estimate, that religious bounty
01 which Ι have already had so many and such magnificent
proofs. This I am to know by the appeal Ι now make 101 3
renewed effort, in the form 01 a general collection, as before,
throughout the diocese. Ι shall not disguise 110111 you that the
larger share 01 our task remains yet to be accomplished, and
that 11 you have been generous already, we cannot help asking
>you to be still more generous in the present instance. Ι 3111
encouraged to believe that you will be so. The past guarantees
the future, and the noble generosity which has carried forward
this diocesan work to so advanced a stage, within so short a
time, is an assured earnest that you will not cease to aid it
forward, till we have the happiness 01 8661118 it completed.

It is unnecessary to expatiate on the importance 01 such an
institution in the diocese. Its high and holy destination pro-
claims the momentous interests it involves, and the vital in-
fluence it is to exert on the religion 01 our people 101 generations
to come. The age we live 111 18 pre-eminently an age 01 progress.
Whilst all things else move onward‚ the education 01 our
vclergy must not remain stationary‚ and it is only in a Seminary
suitably appointed ’ and properly regulated that the young
aspirant to the sacred ministry can have the advantage 01 311
education which( with a liberal and accomplished culture 01
111111(1, will combine a training 01 1118 dispositions and a formation
01 1118 habits in conformity with his sacred vocation. In con-
tributing, therefore, to the erection 01 3 seminary, such as we
are endeavouring to establish‚ you will have the merit 01 pro
pagating the priesthood 01 the diocese, and, at the same time,
vsecuring 101 them an education, which, with the Divine blessing‚
will render them worthy 01 their august mission as “ Minister.»=
’01 Christ and dispensers 01 the Mysteries 01 God.''

But, as I have already informed you, the seminary is not
destined 101 ecclesiastics alone. It is intended to provide fo:
the education 01 lay pupils besides. In this we have a double
-object to attain-——a suitable education according to the require-
ments 01 the day3 and to withold, moreover, our youth 01 the
higher and middle classes from educational establishments
