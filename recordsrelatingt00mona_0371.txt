ST. MANOHAN, HIS OHUROH AND sHRINE.

ABOUT three miles north-east of Ferbane‚ King's Gounty, skirt-
ing the main road to Clara, may be seen the site of the once
celebrated monastic establishment, founded about the middle of
the seventh century, by St. Manchan of Liath. Standing on a
low swell, an armlet of well—reclaimed bog, it gently rises above
the extensive moors with which it is almost surrounded. Here,
in the midst of scenery of a character altogether desolate and
lonely, but poetic and sublime, are to be found what remains of
the Ohurch and house of Manchan. Both repose beneath the
shadow of one of the “ Seven Feci-r Oastles'' of MacCoghlan of
Delvin Eathra, and within sight of St. Columb's famous Dur—
row, and the now celebrated Intermedjate College, conducted by
the J esuits at Tullabeg. Lemanaghan was originally subject to
the jurisdiction of Clonmacnoise, having come out from that
great centre of religion, science‚ and art, as a monastic foun-

*elangui-ke so many others of our once famous abbeys, it had its
origin in royal munificence‚ as the following passage, taken from

the “ Annals of theFour Masters'' will clearly show :—

“ A.D. 645, the battle of Carn Conaill (probably Ballyconnell, in the vicinity
of Gort, Co. Galway), was gained by Dermot, King of Ireland, over θυίαν-ε,
King of Connaught, in which the two Cuans were killed—viz„ Cuan, the son
af Euda, King of Munster 3 and Cuan, the son of Connell, Chief of Hy-Figente ;
and also Talmnach, chief of Hy-Liathin. Guaire was routed from the field.
On marching to the battle, King Dermot passed through Olonmacnoise, and the
congregation of St. Kieran prayed to God for his succeSS, and through their
prayers he returned safe.

“After the King’s return he granted Tuaim-n-Eirc, i.e., Liath Manchan,
with its divisions of land, i.e.‚ (all the lands included under that name), as an
Altar Sod or Altar-land to God and St. Kieran‚ and he pronounced three male·
dictions on any future King of Meath if any of his people should take (with
violence), even so much as a drink of water there.'’

MacGreoghegan, in his translations of the Annals of Clon-
macnoise, gives much the same account :—

“ The battle of Carne-Connell, on the Feast of Pentecost, was given by
Dermot MacHugh Slane, and going to meet his enemies went to Clonvicknoise
to make his devotion to St, Queran, was met by the abbots, prelates‚ and clergy
of Clonvicknoise in procession, where they prayed God and St. Queran to give
him victory over his enemies, which God granted at their requests, for they
had victory, and slew Cuan, King of Munster, and Cuan, King of Feiginty, and
so giving the foyle to his enemies, returned to Clonvicknoise again to congra-
tulate the clergy by whose intercession he gained the victory, and bestowed on
them sor ever Foymincrcke, with the appurtenances, now called Lyavanchan, in
honour of God and St. Queran, to be held free, without any charge in the world,
in so much that the King of Meath might not thenceforth challenge a draught
of water thereout by way of any charge. '³
