These fortified Duns, he adds, were the residences of the kings
and chiefs of that time. Such a mound was the Moat of
Granard, and, therefore, Ι have said it was in the day of its
initial use—a royal residence and rampart as well. It is now
under grass, whilst its internal chambers, which are, doubtless‚
of the ordinary kind found in such places, are untenanted, save
by the fairies‚ whom popular superstition has rooted there,
never to be evicted by crowbar or other brigade. It has not
been under tillage in the memory of any person living in the
neighbourhood of Granard. The people have almost invariably
felt a great reluctance to put such places under tillage. Tales are
sometimes told of calamities that befel the families or cattle
of foolhardy persons who outraged these dwellings of the fairies
by tffling the enclosure or removing the earth, or endeavouring
to penetrate their recesses. But this is only a superstitious fear.
The Duns, Raths, Lisses of Drogheda, Naas, and Castletown,
near Dundalk‚ are now crowned with modern buildings, and the
iFnhabitants of these towns are none the worse of the supposed
alrles.

If evil results to mind or body followed attempted excava-
tions of such places, fear seated in weak minds‘ and nervous
constitutions, and not the alleged Fairies, produced such effects.

Probably in the chambers of these Lisses, articles of con—
siderable value lie concealed. Having thus determined the
origin and use of the Moat of Granard, what shall Ι say of its
age. Ι have already said the period of its erection can, in my
opinion be only approximated. It is certain that it was in exist-
ence, as Ι have already shown, when St. Patrick visited Granard.
But how long before his advent it was in existence Ι am unable
precisely to determine. It does not seem improbable to suppose
that its erection was coeval with Queen Maev. At all events it
was touched by the sacred feet—(consoling thought for Gra-
nardians) —of our national Apostle, who, accompanied by St.
Guasact‚ climbed its steep sides, until having reached its sum-
mit, they looked upon the fertile plains stretching out in all
directions3 and blest them. I recoUect to have employed my
mind on a certain occasion when making this difficult ascent
with pleasing and ennobling reflections upon the fact and mode
of St. Patrick’s visit to this elevated spot. I derived courage,
strength, and J oy from the thought that Ι was climbing possibly
by the very same footway to where St. Patrick and Guasact
came ages ago. Ι well remember to have on a certain occasion
asked a Dispensary Doctor‚ whose duties frequently obliged
him to ascend steep and rugged mountains, and attend the

wants of the sick poor, how he used to feel when climbing the
difficult heights‚ and he answered ε “ Ι keep thinking it will be
