investigation‚ had been traced to natural causes. Thus, in early
times men believed the heavenly bodies to be gods, or to be
guided by gods. But at this stage science had not begun at all;
it was but the preliminary to science. Nor is it true to say‘
that, as a science progresses, the metaphysical supplants the
theological, to be in turn supplanted by the positive stage.
What we have already observed of astronomy and chemistry'is.
a proof of this. But Dr. Whewell does not hesitate to assert
that there is no science in which this pretended succession of a
metaphysica] and a positive stage can be pointed out. “ There
is no sciense in which the discovery of laws of phenomena, when
once begun, has been carried on independently of discussions
concerning ideas which must be called metaphysica& if anything·
be so called. There is no science in which the expression of
the laws of phenomena can at this time dispense with ideas.
which have acquired their place in science in virtue of meta-
physical considerations. There is no science in which the
most active disquisitions concerning ideas did not come after,
not before, the first discovery of the laws of phenomena. This
may be exemplified in all sciences which have made any pro·
gresS. ι Kepler's discoveries would never have been made but
for his metaphysical notions. And again, those discoveries of
the laws of phenomena did not lead immediately to Newton's
theory because a century of metaphysical discussion was requir-
site as a preparation '’ (p. 354).

The truth is that all three stages may and do coexist in such
proportions as are determined by the peculiar nature of each
several science. The sphere of each becomes more accurately‘
defined as the science progresses: but the most accurate posi·
tive knowledge of the laws of coexistence and sequence of
phenomena can never clash with the natural tendency of the
human mind to refer these phenomena to their causes, and to
seek beyond all secondary causes a primary and first cause upon
which all depends. It is wise to observe accurately and patiently
what is passing in the world around us: it is wise ‘to seek, as
far as we can, the nature and causes of what we observe: but it
is wisest to trace every finite contingent being to the F irst,
Cause—the God who created all things.
