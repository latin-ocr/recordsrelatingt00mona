DR. KlLDUFF. 243

No, no ! Resolve with God's assistance, to resist His graces no
longer. Though you may have hitherto laboured entirely for
³the flesh and for the world, and done little or nothing for the
soul or for God—still it is not yet too late to amend. Begin
at once and despair not, but do manfully. That meroiful God
xwho wills not the death of a sinner, but rather that he be con-
verted and live, now invites and. exhorts you, as He exhorted
'the Jews of old, to be converted and to do penance. He gives
you the same consoling assurance which He gave to them-—
uthai. by a speedy conversion and a sincere repentance, you may
:still escape the dreadful punishments due to sin: “Be con-
verted and do penance for all your iniquities, and iniquity shall
-not be your ruin.’'——Ezek. xviii. 30. lf then there be any who
have hitherto neglected their relig-icus duties, or have proved a
disgrace to the religion they profess by the immorality of
their lives, we now exhort and conjure them not to receive the
‘grace of God in vain—to lay hold on this acceptable time—to
*profit of these days of salvation. If any have been living the
victims of the degrading and debasin g vice of drunkenness, which
is to many the fruitful source of wretchedness in this world and
the cause of their everlasting misery in the next, to them we
:address the same exhortation. We know, and we acknowledge
with the liveliest gratitude to our good God, that the great
body of our faithful people are ever ready to yield a submissive
and willing obedience to the voice of the Ohumh, yet we cannot
¹conceal from you the bitter anguish and affliction which fill our
soul, on learning that some evil-disposed men, in certain dis-
tricts of this diocese, have been endeavouring to corrupt the
flock committed to our care, by drawing unwary and unre—
*flecting persons into secret societies, which the laws of God and
>of the Ohurch condemn. Sacrilege at the altar, drunkenness‚
theft, robbery, premature and ignominious deaths on the scaffoffl,
the shedding of innocent blood by night and by day, the
separation of husbands from their wives, and of children from
their parents, are the effects, and the only effects, these societies
have hitherto produced. We have again and again repeatedly
implored, and we now again implore such of our people as be-
long to these accursed societies, to disconnect themselves from
them at once and for ever; until they do so, they are dis-
⁷>obedient children of the Oatholic Church‚ and as such justly
vexcluded from all participation of the sacraments. In your
wonted zeal and persevering co-operation‚ venerable brethren
of the clergy, we rely for assistance in rooting out this baneful
evil from amOng our people. You will be instant in season
:and out of season in bringing home to the minds of all
:a deep conviction, that combinations opposed to the laws of God
