MINUTEs or EVIDENCE. 179

*οἱ theology. It‘might have been quoted as the doctrine of some
few divines of former ages ; but I do not recollect to have heard it
maintained by any of the present professors of the Roman Uni-
versity.

Was the contrary doctrine taught ?—I did not hear the con—
trary doctrine taught3 Ι heard the arguments exposed.

You heard the arguments in favour of the civil and tem—
poral power of the Pope exposed P—Yes.

As erroneous ?—1 cannot precisely recollect what the deci-
sion of the professor was, but Ι can state that he did not require
¹any student to believe either the one side or the other.

Will you state what was your own opinion P—-As to the
doctrine of the temporal power of the Pope, my own opinion
was, that it was perfectly erroneous and almost absurd3 and Ι
·can add, also, that such was the opinion, as far as I could ascer—
tain of all the students in the University, without any ex·
·ce tion.

PWVere there any other Irish students in the college in which
you were ?—When I went there, there was none but myself,
afterwards one or two more were admitted.

How long had you been returned to Ireland before you were
«elected to the chair you now fill ?—I was in Ireland about two
months before Ι was appointed.

Were you five years in the University of Rome ¹?-I was
nearly five years in the city, but I did not study five years in
the University. I studied only three. I had already finished
my studies on going there, and I went chiefly for the purpose
1of taking the degree of Doctor of Divinity‚ which I obtained
after three years' attendance.

Were there any other candidates for the professorship of
Dogmatic Theology when you obtained it P—There was only
another candidate who came forward, but I was appointed by
concursus, which lasted four or five dayS, for the purpose of
..ascertaining our relative fitness for the situation.

Your appointment you consider as in the nature of an elec-
tion, and not in consequence of any particular recommendation
given ?—I dare say I was recommended by my own Bishop,
and, I presume, there was nothing obj ectionable against me.

Will you state the way in which your election took place
by a concursus P-When the chair Ι now fill became vacant,
‘there was public notice given, that any person who wished to
concur for that situation might come forward and stand a con·
cursus3 that is a competition with any other candidates who
might offer themselves; no person came forward but one other,
and the Trustees‚ who were constantly present during our
‹different examinations, were pleased to decide in my favour.
