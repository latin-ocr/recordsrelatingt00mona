amount I am able to give is but a trifle3 if I give it, it will
scarcely add anything to the general fund. If I withhold it, it
will not be missed from so large an amount.'' This mode of‘
reasoning may occur not only to individuals, but to the popula-
tion of an entire parish; which, extending its influence‚ would
mar the general effort to a degree it would be difficult to cal-
culate. Instead, then, of a mode of reasoning which would be
fatal, let us say that the work before us is not the work of the
diocese generally, but of each individual in particular. Let
each one of us say, ‘⁶ I, too—I, in particular, am called upon
to have my share in this work; to contribute, according to my
means, towards its execution.'’ Even the widow, the poor
widow, will not exempt herself, recollecting the example of
the widow’s mite in the Gospel, and feeling that her reward
shall exceed the reward of those who will have given more
largely, but from their abundance.

I should wish it were in my power to appear amongst you
personally in your respective parishes‚ in order to enjoy the
gratification of receiving from you immediately this tribute,
and of expressing to yOU, in person, my gratitude on behalf of'
religion. As this, however, will be impossible, consistently
with the other heavy and important duties I have to attend to,
I must be content to confide this duty to our beloved clergy, in
their respective localities, confidently relying‚ as well on their·
zeal, as on the ready correspondence of the faithful. The
clergy will, therefore, carry out the arrangements made at our
late conferences, for rendering the collection successful 3 and
they will make the faithful acquainted with the time and
manner of giving in their subscriptions. They will, moreover,
explain to the faithful that, sharing in the erection of the
Seminary, they will share also in all the good works that will
be performed in connection with it, as long as it will exist3
and that once every year the entire community of priests and
students will offer up their fervent prayers, with Solemn Office
and High Mass for the dead, in the collegiate chapel, for the
eternal repose of all the deceased contributors.

Again recommending this diocesan undertaking to your
zeal and pious generosity, I desire to remain, Venerable
Brethren of the Olergy, and dearly beloved Brethren of the
Laity‚ in the love of cur Lord J esus Christ, and of His Immacu-
late Mother‚ and under the invocation of our glorious patron,

St. Mel.

Your ever devoted servant in Christ,

ἦ· JOHN KILDUFF.
