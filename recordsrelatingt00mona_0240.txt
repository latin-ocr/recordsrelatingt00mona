Dearly beloved Brethren in Christ,

The time is now approaching when the Church annually
calls upon her children, in the words 01 1110 Prophet Joel, “ to
‘be converted 10 1110 Lord with their whole hearts‚ in fasting, in
weeping, and in mourning.''—Joel, ii. 12. Filled with solici-
tude 101· 1110 salvation 01 your immortal souls, 101· which we

,and entreat you, dearly beloved brethren, to profit 01 11118 solemn
admonition—to commence the holy season 01 Lent by entering
011 0 course 01 penance, in order to satisfy the justice 01 God 101·

*city should be destroyed, on account 01 1110 wickedness in which
they abounded, the Ninevites had immediate recourse to penance,
‘and the penance which disarmed the anger 01 God was turning
efrom their evil ways, fasting‚ and prayer.—J onas, iii. In the

Judith, ch. iv. The wicked Achab had recourse 1ο sasting and
similar acts 01 penance to avert the J ud gments 01 Grod denounced
10 him by the Prophet Elias.—3 Kings‚ xxi. 27. WVhen the
picus King J osaphat was about being attacked by his numerous
