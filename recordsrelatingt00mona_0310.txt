It was amost brilliant display. Dr. (now hisEminence) Moran
obj ected to the proofs of the Real Presence in the Most Ador-
able Eucharist, taken from the words of promise in the sixth
chapter of St. John. Dr. Comoy objected to the authenticity
of that celebrated text to be found in the First Epistle of
John, c. 5, v. 7, from which a proof is taken to establish the*
Catholic doctrine regarding the Blessed Trinity. Dr. (now
His Grace Archbishop) Walsh, objected to the doctrine of
Transubstantiation, and Dr. Molloy, to the proofs usually taken
from the “ WVords of Institution.'' It was a most learned expo-
sition of doctrine and learning all round3 the audience was-
select and critical. Those amongst them who were educated at
Maynooth were brought back in thought to the public Theses-
on the Dunboyne Establishment, at the end of each Academical
Year, in its best days. But the form of Thesis at the catholic
University was somewhat different, being altogether Roman.
The candidates obtained, and most deservedly, the high honours»
they came to contend for. After a brief reference to Dr.
Oonroy's diary, a Sermon and Essags will be reproduced in these
collections, as a sample of what he was as a preacher and
writer. I have only to add, that it was generally said in well-
informed circles, the Apostolic Delegate to Canada would, if.
he had lived a few years more, be elevated to the Cardinalite.

Qud December, 1874. Probably there was a second from that
date down to his last illness3 if so, it has been mislaid or lost.
The text from Genesis is remarkable when considered in con-
nexion with his early death. This register contains the follow-
