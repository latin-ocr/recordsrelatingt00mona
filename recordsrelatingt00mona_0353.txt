pastors, the Rev. Samuel Power and Rev. Mr. Leoni, to build a
:new church in each of their districts.

“ In vain did these Missionaries answer them that there
were no stones in the neighbourhood to build with in masonry,
¹and that there was no money to build in wood. ‘It is all the
:same,' they urgently repeated, ‘ begin once, good Father; and
if we cannot finish the church before our death, we will beg of
-our children to finish it themselves.' ‘ But, my friends,’ said Mr.
Power to them, ‘ there are no stones at Sauterre or in the
*neifflibourhood.;Vi‘l{)earlFalizzh‡r‚' {lfiey ansvgered, ‘iffere are {plcks
111 e sea3 we go oo or em, an we w conve em
to bujld our church.’ y

“ The respectable clergymen did not think that they could
realise their project3 nevertheless, they did not like to offer
further opposition to these pious wishes. Immediately, these
worthy people, without being frightened at the dangers and
the obstacles‚ put their hands to the work. Attracted by the
novelty of the sight, the inhabitants of the island floek to the
·seashore to witness the courage of those intrepid men, who,

singing the praises of God, braved the winds and the waves3
but astonishment and admiration were at their height, when,
after unheard—of exertions‚ they saw come from the bosom of
‘the sea a sufficient quantity of stones to build the chureh.
Although the site of the new edifice was at a considerable
rdistance from the coast, our indefatigable blacks carried them-
selves all the materials, with the exception of the large blocks,
which they were obliged to roll to their destination.

, “ This church is one hundred and twenty feet long and
-sixty broad. It is also our labourers who have gratuitously con-
veyed all ‘the other materials, and, moreover, every three months
veach of them gives the wages of a week to pay the masons.

“ In the neighbourhood of the Bag] there are no stones in
the sea or on the land 3 one must travel near five miles to find
any. Now, the catholice, having no horses, and the roads
being, moreover, bad, carried on their heads to that great dis-
tance all the stones required for the building of their church. The
walls were finished last year at the time I visited that parish.*

Dr. Smyth was a'very able prelate. 1 have been told by
the Rev. Patrick Murray, the much respected P.P. of Bally-

machugh, who saw several of the Archbishop's letters, that his

Grace's penmanship was splendid, an accomplishment of which
all great men cannot boast.
