60 DIOCESE or ARDAGH.

Duleek‚ county Meath, and from thence it took the name of
Damhliag (i.e.‚ Duleek), for before this time the churches of
Ireland were built of wattles and boards. This was certainly
one of the first churches built in Ireland of stone and cement.
Now Tighernach, an annalist of undoubted authority, of whom
I intend to write something later on, because he belonged to
Clonmacnoise and was one of its greatest scholam, tells us that
Cianan was consecrated a bishop by St. Patrick, and that he
died in the year 490, three years before the Apostle himself.
He furthermore assures us that Oianan obtained high favour
with the Apostle, from whom he received a copy of the Gospels,
as a mark of especial esteem and friendship.” Tirechan, in his
Annals, has the following passage—“ De ecclesiis quas fundavit
in Campo Breg, primum in Culmine3 2nd, ecclesiae Cerne in
qua sepultus est Hercus qui portavit, mortalitatem magnam3

Carthaci ; 8th, super Argetbor in qua Kannanus episcopus quem
ordinavit Patricius in primo Pascha.” From this it appears
certain that the church of Duleek was the eighth stone church
erected under the supervision of St. Patrick, in the plain of
Bregia. A few other stone churches were probably erected
about that period. But there does not appear to be sufficient

eyidlence to warrant the opinion that the Eglais Beg was one
o t em.

Petrie and O’Donovan think there is no stone building at
Clonmacnoise older than the tenth century. Moreover, Clon-
macnoise abounded in woods, whilst there is no stone quarry
within three Irish miles. Besides the planting of the pole, by
the king and saint, bespeaks a wooden edifice.

Mr. O'Donovan visited Clonmacnoise in 1838, and wrote in
that same year some very valuable letters regarding it from
Banagher, where he stayed whilst engaged on the Ordnance
survey of that part of the King's County. These letters are
preserved in manuscript in the Royal Irish Academy, where I
have been permitted to see them. He states confidently that
there are no remains of any building at Clonmacnoise as old as
St. Ciaran ; that there is no church there as old as St. Fechin's
of Fore, or St. Mel's of Ardagh, or any of the seven churches
at Inis—clothran‚ in Loughrea3 nor as old as the church at
Banagher, Co. Derry. The following are the names of the
churches and towers at Clonmacnoise :—
