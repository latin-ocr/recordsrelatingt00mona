but most earnestly, pray your honourable house: that, for the
furtherance of justice, the benefit of society, and the glory of
God, who is daily outraged by the cruel practice of exacting

them for ever in this country—apply the Ohurch lands for the·
maintenance of the poor and other exigencies of the State,
leaving the Protestant bishops and parsons to live in a Christian-
like manner on the voluntary oblations of those who may re-

bound, will ever pray.

The Bishop and most of the petitioners died before the

given, not through a sense of justice, but through fear and
compulsion, and after much public disorder and confusion.

 

THE RIGHT REV. DR. KILDUF F

succeeded to the Sees of St. Mel and St. Kieran. He was born
on the llth N ov. 1820, of highly virtuous and wealthy parents,

the Irish College. He remained there for the period of eight
years, one month, and twenty days, and was during that time
engaged in the study of Rhetoric, Philosophy, Sacred Theology,
and the Scriptures. His masters were some of the most cele-
brated scholars amongst the members of the illustrious Order of
the J esuits. On the 12th March, 1842, he received the clerical
tonsure, and on the l5th November, 1846, the four minor⁴
orders. On the 8th December, 1846, he received sub-deacon-

being only six years a priest, and aged thirty-two years, seven
