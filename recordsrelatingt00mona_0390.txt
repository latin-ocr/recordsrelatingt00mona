cross, in the lowest compartment of the shaft. It is written in
Irish, of which the following is a correct translation :—

“A prayer for Flann, son of Maelsechlainn.’'

The second inscription may be seen on a similar tablet, on
the east side of the crOSS, facing the western door of the church,
and oocupying the lowest compartment of the shaft. The
following is an accurate translation of it :—

“ A prayer for Colman, who made this cross on the King Flann.”

The saint and the king flourished in the first quarter of the
tenth century, and by their order the erection of this cross was
commenced. The first intention was that it should be a memorial
of the erection of the Oathedral only ,· but, its royal founder having
died before the completion of the cross, his grateful friend, the
Abbot Colman, who lived eight years after him, caused the cross
to be made a sepulchral monument also. The engravings on
the west side of the cross relate to the history of the original
foundation of Olonmacnoise by St. Kieran, and are intended,
most probably, to be a memorial of its great church to his
honour. The inscriptions on the other sides portray the chief
events in our Saviour's life, as recorded in the Scriptures.
Hence, the origin of the name of the Oross—the Oross of the
Scriptures. Of this remarkable cross, Dr. Ledwich gives the

following description :—

“The other ornamented crossis at Olonmacnoise. The
stone is fifteen feet high and stands near the western door of
Teampull Mac Diarmuid. Over the northern door of this
church are three figures: the middle, St. Patrick, m pontifica-
libus ; the other two, St. Francis and St. Dominio, in the habits
of their Orders. Below these are portraits of the same three
saints and Odo, and on the fillet is this inscription z—‘Doins.
Odo Decanus Oluanm. fieri fecit.’ Mr. Odo, Dean of Clon-
macnoise‚-caused this to be made. This inscription refers to
Dean Odo's re-edifying the church, and must have been about
the year 1280, when the Dominicans and Franciscans were
settled here and held in the highest esteem, as new Orders of
extraordinary holiness. The figures on this cross are comme
morative of St. Kieran and this laudable act of the Dean. Its
eastern side, like the otherS, is divided into compartments. Its
centre, or head and arms, exhibit St. Kieran at full length,
being the patron of Qlonmacnoise. In one hand he holds a
hammer and in the other a mallet, expressing his descent: his
:father being a carpenter. Near him are three men and a dog
