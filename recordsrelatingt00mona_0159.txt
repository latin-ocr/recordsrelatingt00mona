markable for common sense, and the practica] and satisfactory
administration of his diocese. He was a great patron of talented
young priests, and thus compelled Dr. O'Higgins to stand the
Concursus at Maynooth against Dr. Benehan‚ who was after-
wards president of that college. Some few days after the
examination at Maynooth, Dr. Magauran held a conference
of his clergy in the different deaneries, and the compiler heard,
some twenty-three years ago—from the late Very Rev. K.
Kilroe, P.P., St. Mary’s, Athlone, who, at that time, was a young
priest just home from college, and without a mission, and on
that account was taken around by the bishop to the different
places where the clergy assembled—that there was no business at
any of the conferences. It was kept asa holiday‚ the bishop
was so pleased at the brilliant examination of Dr. O'Higgins,
he entertained them with a most interesting and pleasing
account of the triumphant and crushing defeat dealt out by the
ex-professor from Paris to Dr. Renehan. “I have never wit-
nessed,'’ said the bishop, “ such a display of theological learn in g.’'
Even the students of Maynooth, although naturally on the
side of the candidate of their own college, after the first day
took to cheering and clapping O’Higgins.

Dr. Magauran had a noble and commanding presence, and
was very affable and simple in his manners, a great favourite
with his clergy and people.

It is said that he and the late Very Rev. Dean Farrelly‚ P.P.‚.
of Ardagh‚ went to Dublin, on the occasion of the visit of George
the 1V. to that city, and were presented to his majesty, who
afterwards observed, ‘⁶ they were the two finest-looking eccle-
siastics in Great Britain.''

Dr. Magauran died in 1829, at Ballymahon, where he re-
sided, and was interred in the little church there, at that time
the pro-cathedral. His remains still repose within its renovated
walls. I am sorry, through respect for his memory, and the
natural wishes of the several priests of his family (for his was,
and is, a Levitical family), that I bave not been fortunate enough
to obtain more details regarding this good bishop. I can,
however, assure them, that Ι exhausted all the means at my
disposal, in the endeavour.
