to the Pope, no injury would be done; and, in that 0666, it-
would be binding ; because, when accepted by the sovereign, i't-
forms part 01 1116 law 01 1116 (101111111011.

The question supposes the soverei gn to do nothing, perhaps.
owing to never having heard 01 the Bull ; in that case, would
the Bull be binding in that particular country or not ?—I must
repeat that Ι 66111101 conceive any Bull to be issued which would
not come to the knowledge 01 the sovereign3 because, most
certainly, 11 6 Βι111 106 issued by the Pope which would clash
with the rights 01 6 sovereign, it cannot be supposed that he-
would not be made acquainted with its contents, either by his
magistrates or ministers.

Have not the sovereigns 01 111061 of the Catholic States 01
Europe deemed it necessary to guard against the possibility 01
such Bulls being issued, by requiring that all Bulls 110111 1116 Pope,
except those that merely regard the conscience 01 individuale,
should be submitted to the public authorities 01 1116 country P-'
Ι believe it is the case. Ι know it is so in France and Austria.
When Ι was in Vienna, I made it my business to inquire 01
601116 01 the professors 01 the University‚ and Ι found their
principles, with respect to the Four Articles 01 France, to be in
accordance with those 01 French divines, that is, that they most
ardently support the doctrine 01 those ArticleS.

Supposing the Pope were to issue a Bull to this country,
which should undertake to depose his Majesty, and to absolve⁴
his 6111136016 110111 their allegiance, and should command them
to 30111 with any Foreign Power in attacking the Government
01 11116 country, or should enjoin them to resist the temporal
authority 01 his Majesty, would you consider it the duty 01 Roman
Catholics to resist such a Bull ?—We implicitly swear, by our
oath 01 allegiance, to resist such Bulls3 that is, we swear the
Pope has no such right, and 01 course 11 116 were to act upon a
right which we swear he has not, it would be our duty to
oppose it 3 but Ι must add, that Ι 66111101 admit the hypothesis.

1n the present state 01 things, 101· the Pope will certainly never
issue such a Bull.

Supposing a Bull 01 1116 Pope should declare that it was 101
1116 good 01 1116 Church, or 01 1116 Faith, that the Roman Oatholic
subjects 01 his Majesty should rebel against him, would you
think that the Roman 0611101106 ought 10 (10 60 P—It would be
no matter what was the motive urged by a Bull, importing that-
we were to rebel against his Majesty, we never should feel our-
selves authorised to obe) it- ; because we should then conclude
that the Pope was wrong, and that we were right.

Have you ever heard it taught or insinuated by any class 01
Roman 0611101106 111 11116 country that the Pope might absolve„-
