CLoNMACNoisE, on THE sEvEN CHURCHES. 49

to witness St. Thomas in the enjoyment of these spiritual
favours, concealed himself one night in the church. Thomas
came in when all were at rest. and approached the crucifix of our
Lord, in the chapel of St. N icholas, and remained there a con-
siderable time. He was afterwards lifted two cubits in the air
in an ecstasy, and so remained for a long time. Whilst the saint
was entranced, Fra Dominico heard Christ's voice distinctly
saying from the image, “Thoma‚ bene scripsisti de me3 quam
recipies a me pro tuo labore mercedem ?'' “Domine non nisi
te,'' was the answer. Ι know there are some who read visions
with sceptical and unbelieving eyes. ¹I know they would as
soon give credence to the dream of Socrates and the coming of
the young swan from the groves of Academus and nestling in
his bosom, and then soaring aloft, “how she sang sweetly over
him.'' As well might it be expected that the un-Oatholic mind
would believe in the tale of the bees, said to have poured honey
into the mouths of infante fast asleep in the bowers of myrtles
on Mount Hymettus.

Such personS, however, do not know anything of God's ways
and· relations to his saints. They rejoice in their hard heads,
and we do not envy their joy.

I have observed already that Diarmid of Ghurch Island, in
Lough Ree‚ was the spiritual father, friend, and teacher of
Oiaran’s early life3 whilst Diarmid the monarch was his tem-
poral friend and supporter. I will now add that another Diarmid
was privileged to attend St. Columba in his last moments in
Iona, and to speak to him the last words before the altar in the

referred to the same period, and that a few months later our saint was sum-
moned to receive his reward. (See Chronicon Scotorum, published under the
(Ιίἰὸιέῗὺίοῃ of the Master of the Rolls, and edited by W. Η. Hennessy, Esq., in

The memory of St. Ciaran was, immediately after his death, held in the
highest veneration throughout Ireland. St. Cummian, in his famous Paschal
Epistle, reckons him among the “Patres Priores'' of the Irish Church. Alcuin,
too, names him as a bright ornament of the Irish nation, “ Cheranus Scottorum
gloria gentis? In all the ancient lists he is commemorated as one of the twelve
great apostles to whom Ireland gave birth, and also as one of the eight founders
of monastic rules in our island. His feast is marked on the 9th of September,
in the Martyrology of Tallaght and all our other Martyrologies. st. Augus,
in his Felire, thus celebrates him on that day 2—-

“ A great solemnity that filis territories,

The glorious festival of Ciaran of Cluain.”

Ῑῐι the gloss it is added :—“ Thirty-three years was his age when he died.
'Phe three worst counsels that were ever acted on in Erin. by advice of saints,
were the shortening of Ciaran’s life, the exile of Columbkille, and the expulsion
of Mochuda. from Rahinss³ The Martyrology of Donegal has the following
particulare regarding him on his feast-day :—“Ciaran‚ son of the carpenterv
