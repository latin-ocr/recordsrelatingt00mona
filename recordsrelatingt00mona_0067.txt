CLQNMACNOISE, ΟΒ. THE SEVEN CHURCHES. 47

number) who rowed him to Seven Church Island, declared that
they saw, three weeks previously, about noonday, a tall and
stately figure walk with measured step along the waves from
this island towards Athlone. They asserted they saw (each and
all) at the same time the apparition, plainly and distinctly‚ as
far as their vision could reach, in the direction of Hare Island,
and that they believed it to be the form of St. Diarmid, or, at
least, one of the saints belonging to the island.

Be that as it may, the inhabitants of the parish of Cashel
have a profound veneration for the memory of St Diarmid.
Tradition handed it down to them from sire to son, and to-dav
his memory is in benediction amongst them almost as freshly as
it was ages ago. Under the devoted and enlightened pastor-
ship of the distinguished P.P., the Rev. Michael Gilligan, who
now guides the religious destiny of this people, we may truly
say the saint’s honour, veneration, and memory are in safe
keeping. His feast falls on the lOth J anuary.

Ciaran was the worthy son of such a spiritual father.

And here I may make a little digression.

His Eminence Cardinal Moran, Archbishop of Sydney, tells us,
with all that grace and accuracy for which his historic pen is so re-
markable, when writing on Irish Ecclesiastical affairs, that Ciarau
and St. Colomba met in the halls of the great schools and were
intimate friends. In his life of the future Apostle of Iona, the
Oardinal incidentally remarks th at Colomba, like Oiai-an Manant-
sior, was placed from his earliest age under the guidance of a
pious and holy priest. Whilst under his guardianship, Adamnan

 

Father, shall it be narrow.’ ‘I do not know,' replied Ciaran, ‘ that any part of
the Gospel declares it easy to me, and David, son of J essey and the Apostle Paul
feared this way ἲ ’ Then the brethren removed the stone pillow that his head
might have a little ease, but Ciaran had it at once replaced under his head,
saying‚ ‘ that he who does not persevere shall not receive his crown.' Angels
now filled the space between heaven and earth to accompany his soul. He
was brought back into the Eclais Beg, and, raising his hands, he blessed the
brethren‚ and directed them to close the church upon him, whilst he would
converse on heavenly things with St. Coemghen (ina, Kevin*‚ of Glendaloch‚
and St. Coemghen blessed water and sprinkled the place all armmd, and then
gave, for the last time, the holy communion to the dying saint. St. Ciaran gave
his bell as a parting pledge of his affection to St. Coeinghen, and (the writer of
the Life adds) this is called the Boban Coemghen at the present day.”

It is recorded that many of the holy people throughout Ireland were dis-
satisfied at the gift of one hundred churches made to St. C iaran by King
Diarmaid, and St. Columbkille pronounced his death a happy event, as it saved
him from a gathering storm (Colgan, Trias, page 457b).

St. Columbkille held our saint in the highest veneration. A Latin hymn
which he wrote after St. Ciaran’s death is still extant, in which he commemo-
rates his virtues, thanking God for sending to the world so great an apostle
*and styling him the Lamp of this Island :—

“ Quantum Christi, O Apostolum,
Mundo misisti hominem !
Lueema hujus insulae
Lueens lucerna mirabilis.” (Trias, 1 . 472.)
