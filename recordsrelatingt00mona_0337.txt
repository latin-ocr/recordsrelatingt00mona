des Sacres Ooeurs, Banagher ; King's County, the foundation of
that same distinguished teaching community of Nuus, at St.
Mary’s, Athlone‚ one of his own parishes. Here on a charm-
ing site rising over the town in its south-eastern suburbs,
and. commanding extensive and picturesque views in eight
neighbouring counties‚ stands the new Convent of La Sainte-
Union des Sacres Ooenrs, a building recently erected at a eost of
about ten thousand pounds, by Patrick Kelly‚ Esq., Contractor‚.
Longford, from designs made by the late John O’Neill,
Esq„ OE. This large edifice has been erected exclusively from
the funds of the Order of Sainte Union, as they never so-
licit subscriptions, even from the friends of the members of
their own Institute. The foundation on which the building-
rests is gmvelly, and considered most healthy. The views of
Loughrea, on the Shannon, and of Clonmacnoise, or the Seven.
Churches, are such as the Italians would call a bellisszma vista.
The Religieuses of the Convent devote themselves to the higher·
education of young ladies, for which they are specially suited
on account of their own superior training, received in their⁴
Oonvents in England, France, and Belgium. Oonnected with
the Convent, and under the immediate care of the Sisters is a
Preparatory School for the sons of gentlemen, from five to nine-
years of age. It was Dr. Woodlock projected this great work..
So far its success has been greater than the most sanguine
expected, and there are reasons in abundance to hope that, after·
a short time, it will be one of the most successful Schools in
Ireland. In England and in France this Institute of La Sainte
Union holds the foremost place amongst the educational.
establishments.

I could give conclusive proofs, but I am quite sure the
authorities of that great Educational Pensionat would not bev
pleased 3 as they prefer working on silently‚ and taking slow but
certain results, with the conscientious conviction that they well
earned them before they were received. Within sight of the
Convent, on the eminence just outside Athlone, at the Dublin side,
where Grinkel and his army once placed their cannon before they
crossed the historical bridge, the spectator beholds within a few
minutes' walk the graceful Gothic Church and Presbytery of
St. Mary's‚ and attached to it the highly efficient Intermediate
School conducted by the Marist Brothers. This is another
special work of Dr. Woodlock's, and through it he has supplied
a grievous want of many years' standing, on the part of the·
Catholic youth of Athlone. There was an efficient Primary*

PAssns at the ScmNcE and ART Examination, S. K. L., and two others won
