MINUTES or EVIDENCE. 195

Can you state the name of any author who is considered by
>Roman Catholic authorities to have stated the texts of the canons
cf the councils correctly Ρ Bini, or Binus„ has given an edition
of the councils in four vols, in foli03 Richard has given an
analysis of them in five vols„ quarto ; Harduin has also given a
collection, consisting of twelve vols„ in folio ; but 1 believe that
the most esteemed collection of the Oouncils is that published by
Labbe, in seventeen vols., folio.

Were we to collect from a former answer which you gave,
that it is your opinion that the things handed down by tradi-
tion in the Roman Catholic Ohurch were originally revealed by
-God P Undoubtedly.

All matters comprised in the traditions of the Church? I
mean to say that any tradition on which we found an article of
{aith must have had its origin in divine revelation3 for example,
that children recently born may be baptized‚ we hold by Tradition,
not by Scripture 3 and we hold that the truth has been handed
down to us, because it was revealed to the primitive Christians.

Could you furnish the Commissioners with any definit-ion as
to the power of the Pope in spiritual and temporal concerns,
such as they could apply to any case that might arise of doubt
as to which class any particular subject matter might belong Ρ
Ι think that it is a fair statement to say that the Pope has re-
ceived from God, as Head 0ss the Church, the power of governing
that Church in spiritualities‚ and I am sure that this notion, well
established, would direct any Catholic, or any public person, as
to the application of the Pope’s particular decrees; for, if we find
‘that a Pope issue a decree which would seem to go beyond that
general right which he received of governing the Church, we
should conclude that he exceeded the bounds of the authority
given to him by God.

Do you not conceive that an occasion may arise in which it
might become matter of grave and serious doubt whether the
case referred to spiritualities or temporalities Ρ Will the Com-
missioners have the goodness to put such a case P

Particular cases may be put hereafter ; the question at
Δ present is, whether you can suggest any general rule Ρ Η it is
meant to ask whether it is possible in the nature of things that
the Pope in his particular mandates should clash with the
temporal rights of a sovereign, I think the answer has been
.sufficiently given on a former occasion, but if it is meant other-
wise, Ι do not understand what is meant.

The question is whether any general rule can be laid down,
any principle suggested, any· test, any criterion by which it
might be decided whether the subject matter of a Bull relates to
things spiritual or temporal? I can conceive no difficulty in
