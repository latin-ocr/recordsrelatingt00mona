Does the course of education in the University of Paris
differ materially from that at Maynooth ,9 It is natural to
suppose that in Maynooth, where its different professors, accord-
ing to the present system, are all paid by the College, they
cannot be in so great a number as in the University of Paris
where they are most liberally paid by Government 3 and in this
respect the course of education is much more extensive in the
University ; but if Ι 3111 asked as to the relative merits of the
professors of both establishments, Ι 0311 only say that I am not
sufficiently acquainted with the gentlemen of Maynooth to
institute a comparison. Ι must observe‚ however, that the
encouragement given by the Government to the professors of'
Paris is a powert'ul motive why they should retain their pro-
fessorships for a long time, and, consequently, become clever in
their respective departments.

What number of years do they remain in the University of
Paris? The ecclesiastical part of the University of Paris has
not been in its splendour for some time. Ι understand they
are now re-establishing it, and what number of years they may
require students to remain Ι 3111 not aware of3 but as to the
secular portion of the University a student stops there as long
as he thinks proper.

Do you think it possible that the faculties of the young men
would enable them to comprehend a wider range of study 111
five years than that which is laid down at Maynooth, according·
to the present system Ρ Ι think that if the question is put with
respect to clerical education exclusively, Maynooth affords suf-
ficient opportunities to a young man ; that better opportunities
are afforded in foreign universities, Ι believe, is generally allowed.

Do you think it would be possible to comprehend more than
is comprehended in Maynooth in that time? I think that the
system of studies in Maynooth is such as to require very close-
application from the students to comprehend the matter that is
to be studied within the prescribed time.

Are the regulations with respect to silence the same in the
University of Paris as in Maynooth Ρ The University of Paris
is a very extensive establishment‚ it is not confined to any par-
ticular house or building—it comprised all the royal institutionev
for education in France; hence Ι would require to know the>
particular discipline of all those ,institutions before I could
answer the question.

Are the young men educated for the 01011031 profession in*
France subject to the same discipline with regard to the ob-
servance of silence as they are in Maynooth Ρ The 01011031
