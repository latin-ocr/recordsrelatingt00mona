positive stages3 second, that the metaphysical stage supplants
the theological, and in turn is supplanted by the positive.
Ν either of these statements can be established by induction
from the history of the sciences. Which of the sciences ex-
hibits this triple stage of progress‘? M. Comte replies at
once, by naming astronomy. But admitting for a moment that
his theory is borne out by the history of astronomy, what other
science has commenced with the theological stage Ρ Dr.
Whewell* shows that physics has not, and quotes Adam
Smith's saying: that there was never a god of weight. Nor did
chemistry begin with a theological stage, although it too had a
theological or mythological period, but that period was not its
first. In the ages of alchemy, the substanees on which chemists
operated were personified in a most remarkable and lively
manner. “Gold was the king) of metals,'' says Dr. Whewell
(p. 354), “silver the queen. An object much aimed at was to
obtain the regulus—the metallie young one of the more imperfect
metals.'' So, also, astronomy arrived among the Greeks at a
precision which conferred on its discoveries a value so lasting,
that even to·day they form part of the science‚ and yet long
afterwards the period of astrology came on. If the law were
accurate, it must follow that the theological stage has long since
been superseded in the- case of very many of the sciences: for
M. Oomte himself admits that the crowning science of sociology is
the most backward of all, for the very reason that it is still in the
¹theological stage. Now, in this case, the early ages ought to be
the only religious ages or the most religious ages. This,
however, is far from being the case. Leaving out of con-
sideration a few so-called philosophers, who are not more
numerous now than ever, the entire human race with one
accord admits the existence of a Supreme Being‚ even although
some nations outrage His majesty by giving to false gods
the homage which the true Living Grod alone can claim.
M. Comte asserts, moreover, that even in individual minds
this triple stage may be observed: in our childhood we
refer everything to God3 in our youth to metaphysical
:abstractions; in our riper years we advance to Positivism.
This may be true of M. Comte, who, as we have seen, shook off
all religion almost with his boyhood; but is it true of those
great minds who, while they were kings of science, were at the
same time, according to their own views, the most religious of
men Of such men N ewton may be taken as a type.

We admit, however, that in some of the natural sciences
men attributed in the beginning to God functions which after
