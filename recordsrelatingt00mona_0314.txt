place 01 St. Kyran. ι .

From Arran, St.. Kyran came to this part of the valley of
the Shannon, but not as yet to settle in Clonmacnoise. He was
now a priest; and on the island 01 Inis-Oenghin, inLough Ree,
he practised for eight or nine years the virtues of the perfect priest,
with as much fervour as he had practised on Arran those of the
perfect monk. Surrounded now by disciples of his own, con-
stituted a teacher of the faith, and a dispenser of the sacra-
ments, it was 110 longer permitted to him to shun altogether
the concourse of men. But 116 did all that he could to guard
from the world's tainted breath the gifts he had received, and
the souls that had been entrusted to his charge. St. Ambrose
describes to us the attractions which islands, such as those that
stud the noble expanse of Lough Ree, possessed for the religious
men 01 that age. They loved, he 535 5, those islands “ which,
as a necklace of pearls, God has set upon the bosom of the
waters, and in which those who would shun the pleasures of the
world may find a refuge wherein to practise austerity‚ and
save themselves from the snares of life. The water that encom—
passes them becomes, as it were, a veil to hide from mortal eye
their deeds of penance3 it aids them to acquire perfect conti-

peace ; it repels the fierce passions 01 earth. In it these faithful
and pious men find incentives to devotion. The mysterious

psalmody; and the peaceful voices 01 holy 111611 mingled with
the murmur of the waters against the shore, rise harmonicus to
the heavens.” Here, then, did St. Kyran lead the life of the
perfect priest. Here did he practise the 11116 01 3 priest's life,
that had been given to him at Arran, which his fellow-student,
St. Oarthage, has written 101 115, 311(1 which tells us of “the
patience, humility, prayer, fast, and cheerful abstinence; of the
steadiness, modesty, calmness, that are due from a leader 01
religious men, whose office it is to teach, in all truth, unity,
forgiveness. purity, rectitude in all that is moral; whose chief
works are the constant preaching of the Gospel for the instruc-
tion of 311 persons, and the sacrifice of the Body of the great
Lord upon the Holy Altar l ” (Rule of St. Carthage.) Here
did he reach the perfection to which an ancient Irish Treatise
invites all priests: that “their hearts should be chaste and
shining‚ and their minds like the 103111 01 the wave, or the
colour of the swan in the sunshine3 that is, without any particle

another church was raised to perpetuate the memory 01 1115
