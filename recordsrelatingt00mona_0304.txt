-seen divergencieS. In fact, it was quite evident that his Dun-
boyne training at Maynooth had remained and produced fruit.
In social life he was very amiable and simple. When amongst
ecclesiastic& exclusively, at their social gatherings he used to
sing, sub debitis circumstantiis, some judiciously selected airs from
Moore's Melodies. His residence in Ardagh was too short to
have left any permanent material works behind. The hand-
some and commodious Presbytery in St. Mary's, Athlone‚ is,
I think, the only one. It may be, hereafter‚ useful to
observe that it was his intention to have made a cloister of
glass roof and frontage south, and solid masonry north side,
connecting the present Oonference room in that house, with the
little Sacristy and Church, and to have Sacristy and Church
heated with hot-water pipes, and the cloister used partially as a
-conservatory for well—selected plants and flowers‚ for the decora-
tion of St. Mary's Altars on special occasions—such as Holy
Thursday and Corpus Christi. The Conferenoe Room he in-
tended to be used as a large Sacristy, on the occasion of great
and solemn functions. Dr. MacOabe paid special attention to
the Rubrics on the ceremonies of High Mass, and was very
..anxious that the solemn Office of the Dead should be recited
DISTINCTLY and SLOWLY. He sailed from Ireland, inNovember,
1869, for Rome, to take part in the Vatican Council, where,
needless to say, he was heare} and soal for the definition of the
Papal Infallibility. The writer had several letters from him
‘during the Sessions of that CounciL one of which is hereby
given, to show the great interest he took in the Nuns of
Banagher, and the advancement of St. Mary’s Parish‚ Athlone.

Rome, May 7th, 1870.
My DEAR FATHER JoHN‚

I am quite happy to learn that the Nuns of δῖε· Union‚
Banagher‚ will take Dr. Gleeson's house and premiseS, on the
terms stated in your interesting letter. I fully agree to all their
pmpositions, and let them come immediately. Their arrange-
ments will not interfere with Banagher or Moate, or any other
existing institution. The boarding school in Athlone will most
*conveniently suit the whole diocese. Write again shortly. I
read your letters with much interest. The cardinal arrived
here last night. His Eminence enjoys excellent health; and all
the Irish Bishops in Rome are quite well.

Sincerely yours,
ᾧ N. MAcCABE.

The Rev. John Monahan,
Administrator of St. Mary’s, Athlone.
