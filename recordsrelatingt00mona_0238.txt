and ear-ringS‚ 810, they continued pouring in their contribu-
tions, until Moses had to order them by proclamation to cease,
announcing to them that their offerings were not only sufficient,
but more than sufficient, 101 1110 purpose.—Exodus, chaps. xxxv.
and xxxvi. What an example 101 us, and an example the power
01 which is immeasurably enhanced when we consider the dignity
01 1110 Christian Temple, which is so much exalted above the

Again, we learn 110111 1110 800106. Scriptures that, 01101 1110
Israelites had been some time settled in the Land 01 Ρ10111150,
the Almighty desired that a building should be erected to Him
more worthy 01 Η15 worship. Wherefore, He commanded the
prophet Nathan to say to King David: “ Thus saith the Lord:
shalt thou build me a house to dwell in ⁶? Whereas I have not
dwelt in a house from the day that I brought the children 01

Israel out 01 1110 10116 01 Egypt, even to this day: but have

pious David communicated the injunction 01 Heaven to the

And dying, he bequeathed to his son 8010111011 1110 great task

nation, but a wonder 101 1110 entire universe, than Almighty
Grod vouchsafed to give him the most positive assurance 01 1115
approval and complacency, declaring that His eyes and His
heart would never depart 110111 11101 sacred abode, and that He
