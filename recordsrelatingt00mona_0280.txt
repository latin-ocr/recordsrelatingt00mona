came gradually to learn and know) upon the unselfishness and*
self-sacrifice of his character. The earnestness of his manner·
was the chief cause of the success of his preaching. His deli--
very convinced all of his own thorough sincerity and profound
conviction in the truth of what he said.

In the minds of his hearers there could not arise any such
thoughts as Shakespeare gives expression to—Richard ΙΙ., Act-
V. scene 3, 111 the following beautiful and impressive words :—

Pleads he in earnest! Look upon his face.
His eyes drop no tears—his prayers are jest,
His prayers come from his mouth, but not from his breast.

His thorough and downright earnestness would almost prove·
the truth of his propositions even to the minds of the sceptical„
Besides this clement of success in his preaching, there was
another—viz, his unselfish, self-sacrificing life. The influence·

of such a life upon a congregation, or one's fiock, is beautifully‘
described by Gowper, in the following words :—

“ I venerate the man whose heart is warm,

Whose hands are pure, whose doctrine and whose life,
Coincident‚ exhibit lucid proof,

That he is honest in the sacred causo.
To such I render more than mere respect,

*Whose actions say that they respect themselves.”

To hear Dr. Kilduff and look on him whilst preaching, was·-
enough to bring you, at once, irresistibly face to face wit-h God,
in thought, eternity, and the everlasting truths. Some of his-
discourses are remembered to this day by those who heard them.

And thus it is, one recalls to mind what the biographers of
SS. Charles Borromeo and Francis de Sales, tell us of their·
preaching. The former, laboured under many natural defects-
of voice, manner, and style ; nevertheless, the grave modesty of
his manner, together with the sweet heavenly unction accom-
panying his utterances, seized the hearts and minds of his-
hearers and produced wonderful results. The same is related
of St. Francis. Of Massillon it is written, that so great and
overwhelming was his unction, directly he began to speak he·
conveyed the impression—he could no longer restrain himself‘
from giving expression to the heavenly and sublime truths,.
with which he was full. Dr. Kilduff used little or no gesture..
I read in some review, that his Eminence Oardinal Newman
uses no gesticulations in preaching, and when asked why, he-
answered, the Word of (1οἀ is too powerful and solemn to need
actz’ny. Bourdaloue, it is said, preached some of his most effec-
tive sermons with his eyes closed and hands clasped before his
