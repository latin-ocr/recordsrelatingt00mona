ARDAGH As A MISSIONARY DIOOESE.

The spirit of apostolic zeal and heroic sacrifice which led'
Bishop Erard, so many centuries ago, from his own Diocese of
Ardagh, and conducted him and his disciples to Bavaria and
Ger-many, still lives in this ancient See. Having freely and
lovingly employed the remaining period of their earthly lives
in evangelizing the barbarians of those northern regions, their
bones were laid in silent but honoured graves in the land of
the stranger. The spirit, however, which once animated them,
and made them the instruments of so many useful works
amongst the foreigner, is still active in Ardagh. From few
(if any) dioceses in ’ Ireland has that great Missionary Oollege,
established at All-Hallows in 1842, by Fr. Hand, of holy
memory, received so many students. Few, if any, dioceses in
Ireland have contributed so numerous and powerful a phalanx
of young and zealous priests to preach the Gospel os peace in
distant lands. Dr. Kilduff's Diary records, in his own hand-
writing, over one hundred exeat& given by him to students for
the foreign missions. In All-Hallows Oollege seventy—seven
priests from Arda-gh were ordained. Their names shall 1)6»
given below. At the present time there are sixteen students
there, from the same diocese, preparing to bring the tz'dz'nys
of qreatjoy to people beyond the seas. I am indebted for this-
record to the worthy President of All-Hallows, the Very Rev.
Dr. Fortune. Some of these young priests have, by their holy·
lives and zealous labours, reflected honour on the Oollege in
which they received their education, the diocese where they·
were baptised and confirmed, and the land which gave them
birth. Prominently amongst them, the Very Rev. Dean Dinon,
of Buenos Ayres, and Monsignor Corcoran, D.D., deserve spe-
cial notice. The former, owing to his residence at Banagher
and connection with it in his youth, is claimed by the citizens-
of that town as one of their own. I am aware that other
places dispute this honour and set up rival claim& What is
certain in this matter is, that it was at the altar in Banagher,
as an altar-boy‚ he experienced the first signs of a divine call
to God’s holy priesthood. This took place on the occasion of a
Mission given there by the Vincentian Fathers in 1856. After
consultation with them, he followed their advice with prompt-v
ness and earnestness. Some time after he entered the College
at All-Hallows, and having finished a brilliant course of studiesv
there, was ordained a priest, and went to the Spanish Republic.
There he was appointed a Professor in the Diocesan Seminary,
and a few years after he stood a public examination for a vacant-
