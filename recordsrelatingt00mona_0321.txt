POSH'IVISM. ' 301

The extravagant nonsense which Comte has written about
this woman is almost incredible. To her influence he attributes
whatever of tenderness his system exhibits. She was the
Beatrice of the new Dante, and, had she lived, was destined to
become the priestess, or rather the goddess of 1116 new religion.

At the time of his marriage Comte had but one pupil1n
mathematics3 that pupil afterwards became General Lamoriciere.
By the month of April, 1826, he had sufficiently matured his
system for a dogmatic exposition, which he announced in a
course 01 seventy- -two lectures in his private rooms. It may well
surprise us to find among his auditors men like Humboldt and
Poinsot. After the third or fourth lecture the philosopher
became insane. On Friday, 24th April, he went out and did
not return. On Monday a letter came from St. Denis, whither
his wife hastened, but found him no longer there. She found
him, however, at Montmorency, in a most alarming state.
When he grew calmer he expressed a wish to go out for a walk
with his wife. “ As they came to the edge of the Lake of
Enghien, he suddenly declared that, although he could not swim‚
he should not be drowned if he walked into the lake, and he
began to drag his wife with him. She was young and strong,
struggled, and caught hold 01 a 1166, and saved them both '’
(p. 392). He was placed in an asylum, but his recovery was
slow. His poor mother hurried from Montpellier to Paris to
attend him. On the day he quitted the asylum for his home,
his mother, aided by M. de Lamennais, succeeded in inducing him
to contract marriage before the Ohurch. At home, at the end
of a week his recovery began, and in three weeks he was left
alone with his wife. More than once during this period he
threw his knife at Madame Oomte‚ to frighten her into compli-
ance with his wishes. At the end of six weeks all danger was
over. But such was the melancholy that overwhelmed him at
the idea that he could 110 longer study as he had done before,
that he resolved upon suicide. He slipped out one day and
threw himself into‘ the 861116, but was rescued from death by a
soldier, who plunged in after him. He expressed great regret
for this attempt, and in July was well enough 10 visit his parents
at Montpellier.

In 1828 he commenced his lectures, and this time was able
to complete his course. In 1830 116 published the first volume
of his course 3 the second in 1835 ; the sixth and last in 1842.
'These twelve years were years of incessant toil. In 1833 he
obtained an office in the Ecole Polytechnique‚ which, with other
engagements, gave him an income of ten thousand francs. The
publication of his works raised a storm against him which soon
became so violent as to drive him from his official position.
