session of this country by the English. Magdalen-like‚ she-
afterwards did penance for her sins and died a holy death in a
convent at Drogheda‚ I am glad to be able to say. Look
around and what do you behold ⁴? Yonder on that green fort,
the remains of a castle built by the English, under De Lacy, in
1214, and now leaning over and presenting a pile of huge masses
of dangerously-inclining stonework. Perhaps in its present-
tumbling shape it is emblematic of their bad laws and worse
administration, together with the evil influences on which they
rested so many gloomy yearS‚ but now tottering and falling· fast,
let us hope, to rise no more (cheers). At all events it can
scarcely fail to remind those who have visited Pisa, in Italy, of*
the leaning tower in that old city. Look around and what do-
you behold? Celtic crosses and inscribed stones over which
some of the most cultivated minds and eyes in Great Britain
loved to dwell and declare the most perfect specimens of their class.
of art to be had from those days, in which they were sashioned
by the hand of the sculptor. Look around and what do you
behold Ρ Grass-covered foundations oi schools and a University
once amongst the most famous in Europe and having no
superior in our own land—a University that provided for the>
material as well as the intellectual wants of over 3,000 stu-
dents daily--students collected from every part of Europe,
who came here, were kept for the term of their university
training, and then, like the Troj an horse, sent out equipped in
all the virtues necessary for the proper discharge of the duties-
belonging to their different careers in life—a University in
which were written the most valuable manuscripts and books.
now extant on Irish affairs. Here were composed the Annals.
of Clonmacnoise‚ the C'rom'eon Scotorum, the Registry of Clon-
macnoise, the Annals oi Tigernach, which are the fountains of
our Irish historical learning. Indeed, the Four Masters are-
only an enlarged edition of these manuscripts, which are care-
fully preserved in the Bodleian and British Museum Libraries—
a University, in fine, that most probably gave a Rector to the·
Palatine University, established at Pisa by King Oharlemagne,
for the revival of letters in his kingdom. The Rector oi that
University was the most distinguished scholar in Europe in the<
eighth century. He received his University training here at
Clonmacnoise from its then Rector, Blessed Oolgan the Wise.
His scholar afterwards, the famous Alcuin of Charlemagne’s-
University, lectured daily to a crowd of bishops‚ nobleS, cour--
tiers‚ and others, who, in that Palatine School learned to hold
the harp with Orpheus, and the rule with Archimedes ; to per-
ceive with Pythagoras3 to explain with Plato3 to imply with
Aristotle3 to rage with Demosthenes; to persuade with Cicero,.
