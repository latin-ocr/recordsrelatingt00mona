110 was called home to Charleston by his bishop, who appointed ψ

'him V.Gr. of the diocese. The bishop started a very useful
‘periodicaL called the Catholic Miscellany, and at his request Dr.

Corcoran took up its editorship. The heavy duties of this
”important office he dischargedp with much merit for many
vears, and, moreover, in his leisure hours, wrote a history of the
‘Catholic Ohurch in America. The manuscript having been
unfortunately burned with the Presbytery and Ohurch in the
great burning of Charleston, the history never was published.

Revz'ew, in succession to Dr. Brownson's, discontinued by his death.

The motto of the Quarterly is: “ Bonum est homini ut eum

vincat invitum. Nam ipsa vincat necesse est, sive negantem
sive confitentem.’' S. Aug. Epist. ccxxxiii. Ad. Pascent:

Its first number was issued in January, 1876. Since that
time to the present day Dr. Corcoran has continued its editor.
