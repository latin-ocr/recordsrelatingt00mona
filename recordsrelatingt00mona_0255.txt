DR. KILDUFF. 235—

The Holy Oouncil 01 Trent * treats at considerable length
01 11118 branch of episcopal duty, and recommends the establish*
ment of seminaries as the surest and most efficacious means 01
insuring to the Church a succession of Ecclesiastics worthy 01
their calling ‘·' as ministers of Christ, and dispensers 01 1110
mysteries of God.” † This venerable assembly occupies 118011
with this important subject, even to the extent 01 indicating the>
means that might be resorted to in every diocese for the erection
and support 01 these Diocesan Institutions, and in doing so,
presents them to the faithful as eminently entitled to the
religious generosity alike of the bishop, priests, and laity.

The sad history 01 our N ational Ohurch bears dismal testimony
to the impossibility of carrying out the wishes of the holy
Council in times gone by. To preserve the true saith—the one
truefac'tle—without which it is impossible to please God,‡ and 10
hand it down to us, was the great merit of our forefathers. This
they did at all risks and at every sacrifice, and, blessed be God,
we inherit this heavenly treasure through centuries of persecu-
tion, in which earth and hell were leagued against our holy
religion. These trying times are, indeed, gone by3 but they
left everything in ruins, and the present generation had to
create anew, if we may so say, all our Institutions of Religion
and Oharity. But if “the earth was void and empty, 1110 Spirit
01 Gor] moved over the Ψ31018.”ξ Yes, the spirit 01 11131 wonder--
working faith, preserved and handed down pure and untainted,
put forth its energies and, creation-like, our institutions sprang
into existence and already cover the face 01 the land.

Venerable Brethren 01 1110 Clergy, and dearly beloved
Brethren 01 the Laity, you have shared in this glorious progress
01 religion—everywhere throughout the diocese Ι witness, with
delight, the fruits 01 your pious generosity. And our Diocesan
Cathedral 1 What a monument 1 Its colossal magnitude would
point it out as a national work; yet, in a few yearS, by your
joint exertions, you have almost completed this magnificent
Ohurch.

With such proofs 01 your piety and bounty I can well
anticipate how you will receive the announcement of 3 Diocesan
Seminary, in conformity with the prescriptions 01 1110 Holy
Gouncil 01 Τ10111. Such an Institution is essential to the
complete organization of the diocese. Without it the aspirants
10 1110 priesthood must be imperfectly educated, or they must go-
elsewhere to seek an education which should be provided for
them at home. If, hitherto, we have been obliged to dispenso
with such a resource, we have felt all the disadvantage 01 80-
