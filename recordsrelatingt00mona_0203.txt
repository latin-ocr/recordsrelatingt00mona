them from their oath of allegiance to the king ?-I never heard
that matter discussed that I did not hear it concluded by all
parties that the Pope had no such power.

Are you acquainted with many of the Roman Catholic
clergy in Ireland ?—I am with some, particularly those of my
own diocese, and with some of the Bishops.

Which was your diocese P—Ardagh.

Who is the Bishop of that diocese ?—Dr. Magauran.

Have you ever heard it maintained or insinuated amongst
any of the Roman Catholic clergy in this country, that the
Pope had any right to interfere in temporal or civil matters P—
I never heard that the Pope had any right, as Head of the
Chumh, to interfere in civil 01· temporal matters3 but I do not
recollect to have heard that, as monarch, he might not offer
mediation in those countries where his interference in that
respect might be acceptable.

So far as your information goes, do you believe that to be
the principle inculcated in the course of education at May-
nooth ?—I firmly believe it to be such, and I even think that
they are more anxious to inculcate that principle than any
college, perhaps, that I have ever seen.

Will you have the goodness to read and translate a part of
Dr. Delahoque's Tract de Ecclesia, p. 209, which is headed
thus: “Circa decreta Conciliorum Generalium de Fide'’ P—
The passage referred to is as follows: “Argumentum istud
exordiemur his Bossuetii verbis. Non docent Catholici, quae-
cumque gesta sunt in Conciliis. ea ad Ecclesiae fidem pertinere,
sed eo loco habenda sunt tantum illa quae decreto edito fidelibus
omnibus credenda et tenenda proponuntur. Quod et Melchior
Canus passim docet et Catholici omnes uno ore fatentur.
Cujus rei ratio est quod id sufficiat ut verba Christi firma sint
de aeterna ecclesiasticorum dogmatum firmitate. Nec proinde
labat fides si quae extra fidem haud pari auctoritate consistunt.
Atque certum omnino est multa in conciliis, sine expressa, deli-
beratione ac determinatione esse dicta gestaque quibus adstringi
se Catholici omnes uno ore negant. Multa etiam sunt decreta
quae *non pertinent ad invariabilem fidei regulam, sed sunt
accomodata temporibus atque negotiis.” Translation :—We
shall commence this argument with the following words of
Bossuet, etc. ’

Do you consider the principle there stated, that that only is
to be held as matter of saith which is propounded to all the
faithful as matter which is to be believed and held as Catholic
saith ?—I conceive that nothing can form an article of our saith
which is not revealed by God, and afterwards proposed to our
belief by the Church3 because we consider divine Revelation
