succeeded in 1445 was ‘⁴ Magsamhradhan.'' Perhaps Magsam-
radham was the surname of Cormac‚ who seems to have been
sitting in 1470. Magsamradhan was the surnanie.-—L2sncle,
MSS. Historgs.

To him succeeded Donald O'Ferrall.——Ly}wlz, MSS. H istory.

14-29 William O’Ferral succeeded. He appears in the
provision of his successor. Ware says he was sitting, 1486.

It is beyond doubt that this prelate governed Ardagh in the
beginning of the sixteenth century. He was not only Bishop,
but also Dynast‚ of Annally‚ having retained the hereditary
chieftancy of his family. His Brief of appointment is dated,
according to Theiner, 1479, and Ardagh is described as having
become vacant through the death of John. He was Abbot of
the Oistercian Monastery of St. Mary’s, Lerha‚ now known by
the more modern name of Granard, before he was called to rule
over the See of St. Mel. He is said to have been remarkable
for his learning, piety, and every virtue that should adorn the
episcopal character. The succession in Ardagh during the six·
teenth century is surrounded with much obscurity and confusion.
WVare states that Dr. O'Farrell resigned his See about the be-
ginning of this century, and that Thomas O’Congalan and one
Owen succeeded, and governed it between 1500 and 1510. Dr.
O'Farrell must have, therefore, resigned long before his death,
which took place in 1516. Some writers affirm that he governed
Ardagh until his death, and Thomas O’Congal was Bishop of
Achonry, and that the mistake arose from the Latin word
Achadensis, which was erroneously taken to mean Ardagha-
densis. But it is to be observed that not only Ware, but also
Lynch, in his MSS. His-tom, sets down Thomas O'Congalan as
the immediate successor of Dr. William O'Farrell. Nor does it

rights as Ohief-Dynast of Annally‚ but some of his own clans-
men refused to recognize them. He assembled his forces,
assailed and reduced to absolute ruin his opponent-s, together
with the remnant of the little city of Ardagh. The cathedral
shared in the general destruction, so that only the walls re—-
mained and one altar, canopied by the azure vault of heaven.
There were only four houses remaining in the city,.all built of
wo0d‚ and scarcely any inhabitants, owing to the long con-
