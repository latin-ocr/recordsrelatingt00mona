not appear to have been a religious ceremony, and when
Mac- Oaille put the veil upon Bridget’s head the second time, he
acted only the part of an assistant to St. Moel, who was engaged,
as principal, in performing the religious ceremony. In fact, the
whole context clearly shows that St. Moel ‘⁴ professed '’ St.
Bridget, and it was for this Mac Oaille and she and the other
virgins made so long a Journey over the bog. Canon O'Hanlon re-
marks, in his “Life of St. Bridget,'' p. 61, that it is to be regretted
we have not on record the exact name of the church in which
St. Bridget made her religious profession3 for it is stated in the
Trias‚ “ while the saint made her vows to Heaven she touched a
wooden support on which its altar rested.’' Cogitosus says “in
his time this wood was still green as if it had not been cut down
and barked, but had yet remained attached to its roots and
growing.'’ Now Lynch, in his MSS. “ History of the Episcopal
Succession‚” seems to convey that miracle took place in St. Moel's
Ohurch at Ardagh. The following are his words, p. 2451-
S. Melchuo, S. Meli frater, individuus itinerum comes Virtutum
ardens imitator et in Ardachadensi episcopatu Successor et a
Diva Brigida sicut frater ejus cultus fuit utpote qno affinitatis
velum εἰ conferente aridum arce suppedaneum ab eci tactum illico
viruit et floruit, corticem etiam induens, ad omnis generis
morbos pluribus excutiendus plurimum profuit quod Laurentius
Baronius Ordinis illinorum Theologus Sequenti versu expressit
scilicet

‘⁴ Annoso Saliunt sua germina trunco
Et venit in tumidam verna J uventa tabem.’'

From this, it manifestly follows that St. Moel gave the veil to
St. Bridget, and in his own church of Ardagh, where the miracle,
already alluded to, appears to have taken place. Moreover,
O'Curry in his MSS. Translation, already quoted, states that Mac
Oaille and Brid get followed St. Moel into the country of the O'Neill,
which was called Teffia. Teffia was formerly a very extensive
country in Meath‚ comprehending five baronies in WVestmeath‚
and extending into Longford. ‘⁴ There was North and South
Teffia in Longford‚ the former belonged to Carbry, the son of King
N eill and his posterity, and was called Carbria Guara; the
latter belonged to Mann and his posterity (Mann was son of King
N eill), and was divided from Teffia in Westmeath by the river
Inny. St. Patrick regenerated this Mann in the laver of
Baptism, and built a church in a place called Ardagh, and con-
secrated his sister's son, Moel, bishop of it, with whom he left
Melchuo Oo-Bishop.''— O’Donovan‚ F. M. This extract strongly
confirms the previous arguments ; for it isv admitted 'that
