sects can be counted by the hundred. One by one she has aban-
doned the fundamental dogmas of Christianity, and now, a miser·
able pandemonium of opposed and warring sects—who, among
them, might be said almost to deny everything and believe no-
thing she offers a pitiable spectacle of the folly and delusion of
those who abandon the true light for the treacherous guidance
of mere reason. Before the rationalistic writers of Essays aml
Rea-iem, and the sceptic bishop of the Zulu Caffirs, her guides
and pastors retire confounded and dismayed. They cannot
argue, they dare not condemn. As dumb dogs who cannot
bark, they abandon the flook to be devoured by the wolves.
As we look on this sad and awful picture, and think upon the
end to which it leads‚ surely we cannot render sufficient thanks
to the Author of all good gifts for having confided us to the
care of an infallible guide, and for having made us children of
the Holy Catholic Church, the “pillar and ground of Truth.’'
Yesl we shall for ever love this holy Church, the faithful
Spouse of Christ, we shall hear and obey her voice3 for those
who will not hear the Church are, by command of our divine
Lord, to be regarded as heathens and publicans.

Besides condemning the prevailing errors of the age, our
Holy F ather in his Encyclical Letter calls upon all his faithful
children throughout the world, to raise their hands and unite
their hearts with his in fervent supplications to the throne of
grace and mercy for the spiritual and temporal wants of man-
kind, and by mortification and penance to appease the anger of
God, provoked by the sins of men. To encourage repentance,
and in order that the prayers to be offered up may proceed
from purified and grateful heartS, he opens the treasures of the
Church, and in virtue of the power of binding and loosing
which he has received from Christ, he offers a Plenary Indul-
gence, in the form of a J ubilee to the penitent sinner ; that is,
the entire remission of the temporal punishment due to sin
according to the dispensation of divine justice, after the guilt
of sin has been remitted ΒΥ the Sacrament of Penance. The
infinite merits of Christ, our Saviour, are applied to this effect,
and the good works, labours, and sufferings of the martyrs and
other saints, which derive their value from His grace, are
offered up in union with them, that our deficiencies may be
supplied from their abundance.

We, therefore, by virtue of the authority and instructions
conveyed to usin the aforesaid Encyclical Letter of the 8th
December last, declare that the J ubilee will commence on
Monday, the first day of May, and will continue during the
whole of said month, in the following parishes of the Diocese of

Ardagh, viz., Gallen and Reynagh, Clonmacnoise‚ Moat-Colry‚
