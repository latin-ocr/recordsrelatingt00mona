from Tivoli on the terrible day, the 22nd October, of course·
without knowing what had been prepared by the revolutionary

Please give my kindest remembrance to Fr. Burke, all your
other worthy colleagues, Dr. McHale, Mons La Oroix, 810.
Believe me, my dear Dr. McOabe, with most sincere and cordial
respects, and best wishes and prayers for your tempora] and
eternal happiness and success in everything, in which I am
joined by Fr. Maher‚

Yours sincerely and respectfully,

MY DEAR DR. Momm,-

You Ι will not congra‘mlate, but Ardagh I do most
heartily, 011 your elevation to the Episcopacy. Providence has·
been kind to the priests and people in giving them such a
successor to their lamented bishop. As regards myseff, I look
upon your appointment as the greatest blessing. Your enlight-
ened prudence and zeal will be a guide for me, and be assured
my dear Lord, that it was with the most intense delight and
satisfaction the news of your appointmcnt by the Holy See
reached me, as I always entertained a well-grounded hope that
you would be one day a member of the lrish Hierarchy. This
was a dream of mine before Ι had the pleasure of making your
persona] acquaintance, thank Grod Ι have lived to see it realised.
Wishing you every messing,

Ι am, my dear Lord,
Very sincerely yours,

Rt. Rev. Dr. McCabe.
