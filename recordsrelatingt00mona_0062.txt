fluence, and the benevolence of some of his devoted friends and
followers, this monastery became in a few years fully adequate
to meet all the purposes originally contemplated by its apostolic
founder. N ay, more, the fame of his sanctity, wisdom‚ and
learning, attracted such a number of followers and disciples that
the limits of the island were deemed insufficient for their
accommodation, and therefore he resolved to resign the govern-
ment of this monastery and go further south. Accordingly, he
handed over this fiourishing Abbey to his trusted and beloved
disciple, St. Domnan, or Donan, and left the island. For six
hundred years and more it fiourished as a centre of sanctity,
learning, and other civih'zing influences. It produced, amongst
others, that great and learned man Augustin Macgraidin, author
of a complete History of the Acts of Saints of Ireland and the
Annals of this Monastery down to his own time.

Gospel of St. Matthew‚ and was engaged at the words, “omnia quaecumque
vultis quod faciant vobis homines, facite illis similiter.” Our saint said to
him: “ This is my book of study, but it is meet that I should do to others
what I would wish to be done to myself ; take with thee this book.” N ext

one of the company said: “Half-Matthew shall be his name 3 '' but Finnian
chided him, and said, “Not such shall be his name 3 but half of Erin shall
be subject to his rule.” Among the presents made to his master by St.
Ciaran, was a gift of corn Which, in after times, was known as Ana Findein,
1126, the riches of Finnian. “This corn satisfied all Fimrian’s congrega·
tion for forty days; ancl the third of it was stored up for mvalids, and it
healed every disease; and when at length it crumbled into dust, this. too,

“ Ο Ciaran, Ο genereus man,
For thy holiness Ι love thee;

The reward of thy charity shall be given to thee—
Mueh glory and much land.

“ Ο illustrious, noble Ciaran,
To thee may each response be profitable ;
May thy church be ever blessed
With much nobility and wisrlom.'’
