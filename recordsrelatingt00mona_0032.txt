as it is most truly written, must be sought for in Ireland.
There is in the county of Tyrone, on the west of Lough N eagh,
a village called Hardboe, or as others, leaving out the aspirate,
have written it, Ardboe, formerly famous for a monastery of St.
Colman, surnamed Mucaidh‚ whose festival is celebrated there
on the alst February. It· was destroyed by fire in 1166, since
which time it has continued but a sorry village. Richardson
mentions it (p. 66) in his account of pilgrimages Ι am
fully convinced that this was the place of Erard's birth.
Possibly he was educated among the Nervii, of Belgio Gaul,
which would account for Paul's expression, viz. :—that he was
Nervii Civilitate. A second difficulty remains, viz.‚ his
brother Hydulph is called Niverniorum ortus genere. But the
Bollandists admit that N iverniorum is, most probably, an error
crept into the manuscript for Hiverniorum, or Hibernorum3
and this opinion settles all.

Qndly. The next difficulty which occurs, is of what See he
was Bishop. Some make him Bishop of Freising‚ some of
Treves, and others of Ratisbon, which is controverted by
Hundius, Raderus, and other German writers. But the most
probable and general opinion, is that he was Bishop of Ardagh‚
in Ireland, before he travelled into Germany. So says the
Ratisbon Breviary, and that he governed it in sanctity for
many years; with which Hundius, Raderus, and BruneruS,
above named, agree. Now, it is hard to conceive that so many
German writers (whose diligence and industry in searching into
the ancient monuments of their country is unquestionable), should
conspire to reject this ornament of their country, if truth alone
had not directed them to this conclusion. Yet, possibly, he
might have governed the See of Ratisbon, after his arrival
in Germanv.

erly. As to the age in which he flourished. Here, also,
there are two opinions supported by authorities so repugnant to
each other, that it is hard to reconcile them. The first is, that
he flourished about the middle, or before the end of the seventh
century. The second, that he came into Germany in the time of
King Pepin, or Charlemagne his son, and, consequently‚ after
the middle of the eighth century. It would lead me too far to
discuss the reasons given for both these opinions. John Colgan
has treated this subject with great J udgment and exactness ; and
has proved by very cogent reasons and strong authorities drawn
from the best of the German writers, that St. Erard flourished
in Germany between the year 730 and 754. To the latter
year Baronius inclines. Colgan has proved the eighth of
J anuary to be the day of his festival. Ι must refer the reader
to him and hasten on to other matters..
