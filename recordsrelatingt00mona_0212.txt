192 DIOCESE or ARDAGH.

You have spoken of the Bull “ Unam Sanctam'’; do you
consider that thatBull asserts the right of the Pope to interfere
in temporal as well as in spiritual matters ’.Ρ-Ι repeat what Ϊ
have before mentioned in answering another question regarding
that Ball, that though the Pope might seem to assert that he
enjoyed jure divino the right in question, still he never defined
or solemnly dem-eea! anything to that effect.

We are now going to suggest a passage to you from that
Bull for the purpose of your considering it at your leisure, and
after such consideration giving an answer to the preceding ques·-
tion. The passage, as they conceive it to stand, is this: “ Cer—
tainly he who denies that the temporal sword is in the power of
Peter but ill attends to the word of our Lord, when He said,
‘ Put up thy sword into the sheath ;’ therefore both (to wit,
the spiritual and material sword) are in the power of the Church ;
but the latter is to be used for the Ohurch, the former by the
Ohurch3 the former by the instrumentality of the priests, the
latter by that of kings and soldiers, but according to the order
and sufferance of the priest 3 but one sword should be subjected t0›
another, and the temporal authority to the spiritual power ?''——-
The words referred to, if understood in a spiritual sense, will
by no means prove that the Pope assumed the right jure divino
of interfering with temporalities; for it is perfectly true that
in spiritual matters the material sword ought to be subject to-
the spiritual sword3 that is, it never should defend any cause*
opposed to the law of G0d‚ os which law the Ohurch, and the
Pope as Head os that Church, has the right of judging. But-
if Pope Boniface‚ in the Bull “ Unam Sanctam,'' did really
assume jure (livino the right of inter-fering in the temporalities
of princes, we hold that he erred, and for that error he alone is
answerable.*

Oould you put the Commissioners in the way of procuring a
view of the Bull “ Unam Sanctam?'' It is found in a work
called the “ Bullarium Romanum ; ’' but probably the work does-
not exist in this country.

Have you ever seen that work 1> I have seen it, but haves
not read it all, as it consists of nearly 1¹00 vols. in folio.

⁹⁵ The Pope has the right. jure divino, to interfere in mixed questions, i.e.,
questions partly spiritual, and partly temporal. In asserting so much ther
Pope would assert the truth, and he has asserted it in the Bull referred to,
in language perhaps too vague and general, but certainly not erroneous.

Dr. O'Higgins must have understood the word “ TEMPORALITIES ” to signify
things PURELY and exclusively temporal, having no spiritual or moral aspect;
of which there are very few. Of such the Pope did not speak, could not
specus, and therefore did not err. The hypothesis of the Pope teaching error·
in so solemn a document is impossible, and as such should not be answered

at all.
