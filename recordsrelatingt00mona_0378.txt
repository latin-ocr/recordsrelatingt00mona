{reland without costly shrines containing the relies of their<
ounders.

Cogitosus speaks of the two shrines of Kildare and their*-
costly materials. There were, moreover, the shrines of Saints,
Bridgid, Ciaran, Ronan, Comgall, and a host of others. There*
were the decoratione of St. Bridgid’s Church, of which
cogitosus tells, and the frescoes at St. Oormac's Chapel,
on the Rock of Cashel, not yet wholly destroyed3 there were
the illuminatione of the religious books in which the painter’s .
skill was best known.

There was that copy of the Four Gospels seen by Oambrensis‚ .
and so much praised even by hm.

There were these beautiful works of art and many others*
well calculated to excite admiration. But the Annalists say,
pulcherimum opus quod fecit opifex in Hibernia fuit Scrinium
Sancti Manchani. Surely the words of the great sceptical poet
Byron apply here with double force :—

“ Even the saintest relies of a shrine
Of such worship wake some thoughts divine.”

The following extract from Petrie will, I hope, appropriately
conclude my observations regarding this shrine 1—-

“This reliquary, sadly mutilated as it is, still preserves enough of its
original characteristic features to enable us to form a correct idea of its
primeval, costly, and elaborate beauty, and to become intimately acquainted
with what may be regarded as the final development of that phase of Celtic
art-ornamentation in Ireland, which has excited such a deep interest through-
out Europe in our own time. ’ ›

“And in this shattered, mutilated shrine we behold an impressive
illustration of the final extinction of that graceful imaginative art, as well as
that of the Monarchy, which had seen its birth and fostered its development.''

Throughout this essay I have assumed that the word Moetlzail,
which occurs in the “ Annals of the Four Masters,” is one of
the errors of transcription, or guesses to supply an obliteration
in the Annals of Clonmacnoise, from which they copied the
reference to this shrine. Moreover, many writers suppose St.
Manchan of Mohil‚ and St. Manchan of Lemanaghan, to be the
same person, and thus he is styled the patron of Seven Ghurches‚
and invoked in the Tallaght Martyrology in the following
words :—

“Sanctum Manchan cum ejus centum et viginta fratribus invoco, per*
Dominum nostrum J esum Christum, &c.'’
