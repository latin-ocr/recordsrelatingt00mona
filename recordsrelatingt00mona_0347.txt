’5 Predicate Evangelium omni creaturae.'—Mark, xvi. 15. ‘ Do-
›cete omnes genteS.'—Matt. xxviii. 19. He was fully convinced
by the force of these words, as well as of those of the Apostle
of N ations, in his Epistle to the Romans, X. 17 : ‘ Fides exau-
ditu auditus autem per Verba Christi, omnis enim quicumque
invocaverit nomen Domini, salvus erit, quomodo ergo invoca-
bunt in quem non exediderunt aut quomodo credent ei quem
non audierunt. Quomodo autem audient sine predicante. Quo-
modo vero predicabunt nisi mittantur, sicut scriptum est quam
speciosi pedes Evangelizantium pacem Evangelizantium bona)
Or yet, again, the words of St. Peter : ‘ Verbum istud per quod
in admirabile lumen fidei Vocati sumus.' We well remember that
morning, as we sat in the old chapel of our Alma Mater, All—
Hallows in company with over two hundred students, whose
homes are scattered far away in the Antipodes, on the burning
plains of India, the prairies of young America, and the shores of
‘mysterious Africa—and this in obedience to the call of God's
Holy Spirit—all children of that Alma Mater, whose superiors
and children shall be always dear to us. There did he speak to
us, exposing the wants of his diocese, telling of the great number
of souls in danger of perishing, the many places without a
pastor—then, making an urgent appeal to the young hearts
*beating before him, he called on them for the aid so much
needed, and his appeal was not in vain. For you, dearly
beloved brethren and children in J esus Christ, can tell how the
‘wants of the diocese have been supplied, up to the moment
when it was God's Holy Will to call him to Himself. Let us
2pray for his repose‚ and also for that of his two venerable and
holy successors.

But any biographical sketch of Dr. Monahan should be con
sidered incomplete, if it did not make reference to his great
friend and patron, the Most Rev, Dr. Smith, Archbishop of
Trinidad, Port of Spain. He had been his lifelong true and
⁴steadfast friend, and was one of the first to predict Bishop
Monahan's elevation to the Episcopate. It was also his wish
that he would be his* successor. Moreover, Dr. Smith, although
born in the Diocese of Meath, on the confines of Ardagh, at
Ballymachugh, always considered himself more an Ardagh than
:a Meath man. He entered Maynooth as an Ardagh student.
Besides, he passed nearly all his youthful days with his rela-
tives in Ballymachugh Parish, where his family resided. When

home on his vaoation from Trinidad, it was in that parish he
