teaching better than that of the other professors. He did not go
off in divergencies, and make them so learnedly long, as to
draw away the minds of his class from the main proposition.
N 0 he had the happy method of keeping to his points, and
using clear and brief language in his expositions, and of
putting questions in Moral Theology especially, one 01 which,
at times, would fairly test the respondent' 8 reading of perhaps
twenty pages of a tract. He waS, to my mind, the clearest,
ablest, and most practical professor of them all3 811(1, inlistening
to Dr. Kilduff conducting Conferences, I was frequently carried

methods were so much alike. Dr. Kilduff, 88 11 were, instinctively
caught up 1118 viscera of the subjecta matema for Conference
He refused to consider at all crotchets and puzzles. His clear
and practical mind could not delay on such nuyae. He had a
happy way of reducing to 81181108 gentlemen, the amount of
whose ability and reading 011157 enabled them to raise false
issues, run off in tangentS, waste time in divergencies wholly
foreign to the subject-matter, and leading only to endless and
profitless discussion, without, any apparent show of accuracy,
precision, or even discursive reading of the tract. With such
men it 18 very difficult to argue. They have not even as much
knowledge as constitutes the conditio sine qua non for argument.
Therefore, it 18 111018 difficult to overcome or convince them
than those who know something about the matter; for they
pass rapidly from one irrelevancy to another, until a whole
series comes forth. 10 show not their smartness, as they sup-
posed, but that they had declined a ‘eia recta scientiae et veritatis.
His clear intellect saw at a glance a disputant of this class, and
he overcame him toute suite, by mildly conveying to him he was
disqualified to enter the lists until he had properly prepared
himself. It was thus the bishop was able 10 get through so much
matter in one Conference3 for we had at each Conference not
only a portion of 8 tract on Theology, but also a chapter in
Scripture, from one 01 1118 Evangelists, which some member of
the Conference was called upon to read and explain α Za mode

years before he was raised to the episcopate, there is no doubt
on my mind, at all events, that he would have earned 101· 111111-
