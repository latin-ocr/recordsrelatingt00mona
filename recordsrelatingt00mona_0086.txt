have been named from the same Fingin; and if he be F inneen.
MacOarthy, how could the well have been called Tobar-Fingin
in the year 610. Moreover, Tigernagh flourished before
MacCarthy Fingin was born. The “ Ohronicon Scotorum'’ has
the following passage :—“ A great storm happened in this year
(1015), the greatest that had occurred in those times, by which
the great oak of Reglis Fingin‚ at Olonmacnoise, was pros-
trated.'' I cannot find a record of Fingin MacCarthy in any of'
our Irish Annals. O’Donovan thinks this church‚ one beautiful
arch of which still exists, was erected in the eleventh or begin-
ning of the twelfth century, together with the round tower,
which is so well adapted to it. The learned Petrie thinks it is
as old as the beginning of the tenth century. The other churches-

arg shiown 011 the map. The remains of them are very scanty

O'RORKE’S TOWER

is the larger tower of Clonmacnoisc, and lies north-west of the
cathedral* This tower was erected at the expense of O’Rorke,
Prince of Breffny. O'Donovan thinks it no older than the
twelfth century, when O'Malone Ooarb, of St. Kieran, finished
the erection 01 the Cloictheach. “ The completion of the 01010-
theach (turris) by O'Malone Ooarb, of St. Kieran, A.D. 1124.”—

Four Masters.

1135.—“ T lte Cap (Benn-cover) of the Cloictheaclz of Clon-
macnoise was knocked off by lightning.''

Dr. O'Conor thinks that O'Malone only REPAIRED THE CAP of
the tower this year3 and O'Donovan confidently states that the-
Irish verb, used in the Four Masters‚ signifies not To REPAIR, but
to finish, complete. O'Donovan thinks it was often repaired
since 1135, and that no conclusive argument can be brought
forward to show that it is older than 1124.

There is extant a charming little poem, composed by Erard
MacCoz‘sz', in lamentation of the death of Feargal O'Rorke‚ who
was killed in the Battle of Clontarf, 1014. In it MacC'oisi
represents as prostrate 011 the royal tomb “ the flag of kingsss’
on which gold was glittering. If there is any truth in this
poem, the O'Rorkes must have had a tomb at Clonmacnoise
long before the round tower was erected by O’Malone. Petrie‚
however, who is a higher authority, thinks the erection of this
tower is as old as the year 908, and that tradition afterwards
connected the names of O’Rorke and O'Malone with it, on

'¹‘ In May, 1865, by means of private subscriptions, the greater Round
Tower and the ruined churches of Clonmacnoise were (somewhat) repaired,
and places of safety provided for the detached sculptured stones and ancient
monuments, under the supervision of the Rev. Charles Vignoles‚ Rector of the
Parish, and the Rev. J ames Graves, Hon. Sec.. Royal Arch. Soc„ Kilkenny.
