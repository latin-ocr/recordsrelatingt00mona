s'r. MANCHAN, ms carmon ΛΝΒ sHRmE. 353

It appears to be beyond all doubt that he was very highly
venerated in his time for learning as well as sanctity, for 'Piger-
nach, the earliest of our annalists, having recorded his death as
Bishop and Abbot, speaks of him as one of the most eminent
persons who fell victims to that great mortality which, sparing
neither sinner nor saint, prevailed in Ireland about the year
ssffllt is thus recorded in the Annals of Olonmacnoise, “A.D.
661, Enos of Ulster and St. Manchan of Leith, together with

they are generally three, and sometimes five years later than the
Annals of Clonmacnoise.

Archdall, after placing the death of St. Manchan, the patron ”

of Lemanaghan, under the year 661, adds, under the year 694 :
“We find another St. Manchan, of Leith, who lived after this
year.'' For this he refers to Oolgan. Acta, S.S.‚ page 382, but
the year 694 there is only a misprint for 664, which is the date
of the Four Masters, from whom Golgan translated the passage.
Petrie thinks Archdall’s mind was a blunt one.

In the year 1838 Mr. Petrie visited Lemanaghan, and he
tells us, in the record of his visit, that he sketched the original
church and oratory of St. Manchan, and found it to be only
twenty-four feet in length, and fifteen in width. He added
that it presents to the antiquary an interesting characteristic
specimen of the architecture of the seventh century.” But the
parish church still remains‚ and is situate in the village of Le-
managhan, and is in tolerably good preservation. It is of much
larger size and of later age, as shown from its ornamented door-

Not far distant are three holy wells, to which the blind,

- A tiiqlzer, or paved causeway, leads to one of these wells, and
extends further on by several yards, until it reaches the low
swell on which is to be seen the cell which St. Manchan built
sor his mother. The antiquarian will be much interested on
reaching this spot. This road, which resembles in many respects
that leading from the Seven Olmrehes to the Ohurch of the Nuns,
or Devorqap'l’s restored Ohurch, is paved with large flag-stones.
At the end of it you come upon an old cyclopean building, sur-
rouffided by an ancient Mur, or wall ot* earth, faced with stone-
