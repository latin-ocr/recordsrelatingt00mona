I really think the whole country is overjoyed at your appoint-

MY DEAR LORD, —

From my heart I congratulate you on the great honour
conferred 011 you by the Holy See, creditable to you and hop e-
1111 101 the Cliurch. You will have the distinguished privilege
to take my place as last 101 the future, until you are promoted.
Do not fail to inform me 01 the day 01 consecration‚ at which

Ι shall be sure to attend. The poor old Irish Oollege will miss
you : but God will take care 01 it.

Ι 3111, my dear Lord,

In great haste, yours,
