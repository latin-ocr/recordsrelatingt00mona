CLONMACNOISE, on THE SEVEN CHURCHES. 59

Petrie proves these assertionS‚ by copious references to the
Four Masters of Ulster, and of Tigernach, at the years 839, 890,
907, 915, but principally at 1020, where reference is made to the
great stone church of Armagh. It appears, therefore, beyond
all reasonable doubt, that there was a stone church at Armagh,
in the middle of the ninth century. Moore, who generally
followed the opinion of Harris and his school, in his dissertation
against those who attributed the erection of the churches of
Glendalough to the Danes, maintains that from the year 788,
at least, the Irish had stone churches. Petrie continues his argu-
ment thus——“ It has been already shown that, in the ninth cen
tury, there was a great stone church at Armagh.'' Now, there
are strong reasons for supposing it was the very church erected
by St. Patrick. The most ancient annalists and biographers of
St. Patrick admit that he built a cathedral of considerable
dimensions at Armagh, in the year 444 or 445. Its extent is
given in the Tripartite Life, ascribed even to the sixth century.
“Istis namque diebus sanctissimus Antistes metatus est locum
et jecit fundamenta ecclesiae Ardmachanae juxta formam et
modum ab angelo praescriptum. Dum autem fieret haec funda-
tio et metatio formae et quantitatis ecclesiae aedificandae,
collecta synodus Antistitum Abbatum aliorumque universi regni
Praelatorum et facta processione ad metas designandas proces-
serunt, Patricio cum baculo J esu in manu, totum clerum et
angelo Dei tanquam ductore et directore Patricium praecedenti.
Statuit autem Patricius juxta Angeli praescriptum quod murus
ecclesiae in longitudine contineret centum quadriginta pedes
(forte passus) aedificium sive aula major triginta, culina septem
pedes. Et hae sacrae aedes omnes juxta has mensuras sunt
postea erectae.'’ The dimensions of the church built by St.
Patrick, and that which is known to have been of stone in 838,
being the same, may it not fairly be inferred that the church
burned by the Danes, in the ninth century, was the original
church built by our Apostle in the fifth century. This conclu-
sionis strengthened by F lann, of the monastery, in his great
poem on the members of St. Patrick's household. In this in-
teresting account, still preserved in the Book of Lecan, the
following allusion is made to the Saint’s masons :—

“ His three masons good was their intefligencc,
Coeman, Cruithneck, Luchraid, strong

>They made Damhliags first
In Erinn, eminent their history.'’

There is another argument contained in the Office of St.
Cianan, as given by Colgan. It is found in the following
words :—“ St. Cianan built a church of stone in this place, ‘z'.e.,
