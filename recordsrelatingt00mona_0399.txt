F enagh. An abbey was founded here in the sixth century
by St. Callin, who was its first bishop and abbot. It is said

See. He lived to an enormous age. He received the Sacra--
ment of Extremo Unction from St. Manchan. His body was,
interred with great honour and veneration in the cemetery of
Mochaemhog. His festival is observed on the 13th of November.
The remarkable and interesting work entitled The Book of
F enagh, was compiled by him. He waS, moreover, an accom-
plished poet in his day. The Book of Fenagh has been recently
translated into English, by D. H. Kelly, M.R.I.A.‚ and care—
fully revised, indexed, and copiously annotated by W. M. Hen-
nessy, M.R.I.A. This old book, together with the shrine and
bell of the saint, passed to the hereditary comharbs of F enagh,
or successors of Calfin, who were the ancient and highly re-
spected family of the O’Roddys, or Redahan. This place was
celebrated in former ages for its divinity school, and was the

Creevlea, otherwise Ballyruark or Carrig Patrick, but now
commonly called Friarstown or Dromahare Abbey, is situated in
the Barony of Dromahaire‚ near the town of that name, on the river
Boonid, which falls into Lough Grill. It is an abbey in ruins.

A religious house was founded here for Franciscans of the
Strict Observance, A.D. 1508, by Margaret O’Brien, daughter of
Lord O'Brien and wife of Eugene Lord O’Ruark. She died in
1512 and was interred here. This building was never com-
pleted, although it is said Lord O'Ruark gave twenty cows sor
its erection.

By an inquisition taken in the first year of the reign of·
King James, the last Abbot was found to be seized of onev
caracate of land, and the Rectory of Krellen containing two
caracates of glebe land; the Rectory of Clonlogher, one cara-
cate3 the Rectory of Drenleis‚ two caracates of glebe; the
Rectory of Ballychinechain, four quarters ; and the Rectory of
Kilcrumena one caracate3 the Rectory of Lisamemis, four>
quarters; and the Rectory of Killifargen, four caracates and,
all the tithes of the same, valued at forty shillings annually.

The walls of this abbey are still entire, and the altar is nearly
so. There are several curicus figures inserted in the walls and
