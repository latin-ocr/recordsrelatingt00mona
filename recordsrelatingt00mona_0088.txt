conclusions‚ adopted by Petrie, and for which he has advanced
the following arguments :—

1. The towers are never found unconnected with ancient
ecclesiastical foundations.

2. Their architectural styles exhibit no features or peculiari—
ties not equally found in the original churches with which they
are locally connected, when such remain. ’

3. 011 several of them Christian emblems are obsewable,
and others display in the details a style of architecture univer-
sally acknowledged to be of Christian origin.

4. They possess invariably architectural features not found
in any buildings in Ireland ascertained to be of pagan times.

For the second conclusion, namely, that they were intended
to serve the double purpose of belfries and keeps or castles, for
the uses already specified :-—

1. Their architectural construction, as will appear, eminently
favours this conclusion.

2. A variety of passages, extracted from our annals and
other authentic documents, will prove that they were constantly
⁴ applied to both these purposes.

For the third conclusion, namely, that they may also have
been occasionally used as beacons and watch-towers :—

l. There are some historical evidences which render such a
hypothesis extremely probable.

2. The necessity which must have existed in early Christian
times for such beacons and watch-towers, and the perfect fitness
of the Round Towers to answer such purposes, will strongly
support this conclusion.

TEMPLE-GONOR

is the eighth ruin, and it is attached to the modern Protestant
Church‚ and does not seem very ancient. See Petrie and the
Registry of Clonmacnoise for the further history of this church.
See also Appendix.

Ware shows ten churches in his map of the cemetery of
Clonmacnoise, but eight only remain to this day, i.e., seven and
(gffigss‘sse'z) tower, to which, probably, a church was anciently
attached. The E glais Beg to which the Four Masters refer at the
years 947 and 977, cannot be identified just now, They also
refer at 1050 to Orosna Scraptra, the Cross of the Scriptures‚
which some think was a church in the form of α cross. There is
no local tradition of this supposed church. At the year 1026,
reference is made to a''0azcseway ον parentent extending from the
garden of the Abbess to the Carn of the three crosses. This can
still be traced3 the Cam has disappeared, but the crosses still

remain, two in good preservation, and the third one mutilated.
