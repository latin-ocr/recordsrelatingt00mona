DR. KILDUFF. 259

:seniority resting on merit, its possessor was never passed over.
Time and experience, with very few exceptions (there are excep-
tions to every rule), proved the wisdom 01 1113 appointments.
He experienced less difficulties in connection with his appoint-
ments than perhaps many bishops‚ owing to the decision and
eomaye of lais character. The last important appointment he
made was to the benefice 01 Moat and Oalry. Many expec-
tants having been passed over, and the Rev. P., now Canon
Kearney having been appointed its.P.P., some criticism resulted.
But, after the lapse 01 nineteen years, the wisdom and foresight
shown by that collation are triumphantly manifest. Si arqu-
mentum petis, circumspice. Look at the beautiful new Church 01
St. Patrick's, unsurpassed———I might ahnost say, unrivalled—as
a parochia] church, in Ardagh, having regard to its interior and
exterior decorations. Look at the new and handsome presby-
tery and grounds. Look at the new Ohurch 01 St. Kieran, the
new presbytery at Mount Temple, and the schools, all the work
01 the present pastor, Canon Kearney3 and say, 11 you can, Dr.
Kilduffs clear insight into character and fitness was not revealed
in that appointment. I say nothing 01 1113 Confraternities,
missione, and retreats.

Dr. Kilduff, as a preacher, was, perhaps, the most effective
in his day. I do not mean to convey that weighed in the scales
>of calculation and merit—set up by standard writers on pulpit-
-eloquence—the Bishop 01 Ardagh could justly be declared
entitled to a foremost place amongst the orators 01 1113 time. For
his voice was certainly not as musical and flexible as that with
which Mario was gifted, nor was his manner or action, taking
the word in its widest sense, quite seezmclum reyulas artis Reto-
rc'cae; nor was there any originality 01 thought, arrangement,
or expression about the composition 01 1113 sermons. There
was no striking beauty or flow about his style; but the per-
fection 01 1113 preaching consisted in the apparent absence 01
excellence. His discourses were plain, homely‚ practical, strik-
-ing at the roots 01 vice, and lifting the mind to the great future
rewards. His language was simple and intelligible to all; his
illustrations were taken 110111 the Scriptures, the writings 01
the Fathers, and daily experience 01 all. Whenever it was
announced that he was to preach in any particular church, on a
particular day, multitudes went to hear him, and were moved
by his sermons in a manner and to a degree 01 external expres-
sion, such‚as I have never seen or heard on a similar occasion.
What was the cause 01 1113 great influence over his hearers, in
the absence 01 30 many qualities laid down by writers 011 pulpit
