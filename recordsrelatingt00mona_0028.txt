along the walls of the transepts, of the side aisles, and of the
apse. The campanile, surmounted with a dome and terminated
by an elaborate gilt cross, is an object of great architectural
beauty. On an octagonal base, rising over the roos, are three
projecting mouldings, each sustaining a highly ornate compart-
ment of the campanile. Carved columns sustain the corniceS.'’

The venerated Bishop of Ardagh, Dr. Woodloek‚ has done
much to beautify the interior of St. Mel’s Cathedral. I shall
reserve his special works in this direction for the Chapter at the
end of this book, in which his biographical sketch will be given.

The names of the presidents of St. Mel’s College will also be

given under the chapter relating to the founder—the Right
Rev. Dr. Kilduff.

 

BOUNDARIES OF ARDAGH DIOOESE.

The See of Ardagh originally comprised the country of the
eastern Conmaicne. It consisted of the territory of the
O'Ferrals and O’Quins, in the Co. Longford, commonly called
Annally—the diocesan boundaries being originally co-terminus
with the territories of the chieftains. It also included the
territory of Muintir Eolais, 2?.e., of Mac Rannall (O'Reynolds),

in the County of Leitrim. These two families were descended ’

from Conmacs*⁶ son of Fergus Mac Roy, the dethroned King of
Ulster, by Queen Meave 01· Maud of Connaught, in the first
century. Ardagh is sometimes called by ancient writers Con-
maicne. There are, however, several districts of this name in
Connaught‚ the inhabitants of which were called Conmaicne,
or the descendants of Conmac, one of the sons of Queen Maud.
But Conmaicne. which is synonymous with Ardagh, is designated
Conmaicne of Moyoein, in Brefney‚ O’Rourke's country, which,
according to O'Flaherty, extended into the Co. Longsord. Under
the year A.D. 1475 F. M. it is stated, that F enagh, in the barony
of Leitrim and Co. Leitrim, lay in Moyrein, and by some autho-
rities, Conmaicne of Moyrein and Muintir Eoluis were considered
identical. The Mac Raunalls (O'Reynolds) were the principal
chiefs of Muintir Eoluis, which territory comprised the southern
part of the Co. Leitrim, and extended from Slieve-an-Iarain and
Lough Allen to Slieve Carbry west of Balona in the County
Longford, and contained the castles of Rinn, Lough Scur, and
Leitrim, and the monasteries of Fenagh, Mohill and Cloon.
Under the year '1562 EM. it is stated, that the power of O’Rourke
extended from Caladh, in the territory of Hy-Maine, in the

the Crown of England.
