hypothesis; that the mental regimen, half-theological, half-
³metaphysical‚ to which the present generations are subjected,
is full of contradictions; that Catholicity is an antiquated and
reffete creed, this writer has set himself the task, says M. Sainte-
Beuve, of endeavouring “to set humanity free from illusione.
from vague disputes, from vain solutions, from deceitful idols and
powers? The illusions, the existence of which in the world M.
Littre deplores, are simply a belief in Providence and in a
Creator; the solutions and disputes regard the origin and desti—
nation of things; the powers and idols stand for the Living
Personal God. “Each one may be allowed to represent such
matters to himself: as he likes3 there is nothing to hinder the
man who finds a pleasure in doing so from dreaming upon
that past and that future.'' (Paroles de Philosoplaie Positive, p. 33.)

M. Littre is the author of a translation of Strauss's Life of
Christ, and of several works on Positivism, such as Paroles (le
Plzilosopln'e Positive ,· Conservatisme, Revolcction, et Positivisme;
Aufflcste Combe et Ze. Positivz'sme. He is also editor of a new
edition of Oomte's works. It will still, probably, be fresh in
the memory of many of our readers how successfully Mgr.
Dupanloup exposed the horrors these books contain*

Close upon M. Littre comes the well-known Ernest Renan.
As the former is the legislator, so the latter is the poet of
Positivism. His Life of <Iesus may be taken as a sample of the
working of Positivism in our days. The principle on which the
investigation into the origin of Christianity is therein conducted
is avowedly the Positive principle, that an immutable material
law governs all things, history as well as matter. Hence,
miracles must be excluded‚ and hence such portions of the
Gospels as contain mention of miracles are quietly set aside by
the author. Add to this an art of criticism‚ the most capricious
and wanton that can well be imagined, and who will be surprised
at his grotesque and blasphemous account of the Divine Author
of our religion Ρ.

ΜΜ. Taine, Havet, and About, likewise belong to the
Positivist School, and, in particular, to the literary branch of
it. The following texts, literally translated from the works of
*these writers, will enable the reader to judge of their teaching ε
“There is no free being superior to man;'' “It is man who
-creates God; ’' “God is but a fiction of the imagination;’'
“ humanity is the supreme existence and the only providence.'' †

And yet, in the face of such texts as these, Oomte's followers
-are‘indignant that he and they should be called Atheists. In
