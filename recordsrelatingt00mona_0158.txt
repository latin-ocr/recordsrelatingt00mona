time it was on the point 01 being amicably settled, through the
interference 01 His Grace, Dr. Troy ; but unhappily the Primate
got into fresh troubles through the suspension 01 the Rev. George
Dowd, of St. Peter's‚ Drogheda. The result was, that not only
Dr. Troy, 01 1)111)1111, but also the southern bishops were drawn
into this unfortunate and imprudent quarreL on both sides, which
ended in the absolute resignation 01 Dr. Blake.

Dr. James Brady succeeded, in 1758. He was one 01 the
Superiors at the Irish College in Paris. His Brief was dated
August 21, 1758. Ηο resided in his Mensal Parish, St. Mary’s,
Athlone. Dr. Brady died 18th January, 1788.

Dr. John Oruise succeeded in that same year. He was
elected at Propaganda, April 21, and confirmed by the Pope,
May 18, 1788, through the death 01 Dr. Brady. His Brief was ’
dated lOth June, 1788. He was born in 1750, and died in
June, 1812, and was buried in Abbey Shrule.

When Dr. Oruise went on his visitations to administer the
Sacrament 01 Confirmation, he brought with him a quantity 01
religious 1300118, which he used to distribute to the persons
confirmed. His character was that 01 a very holy man.

The Right Rev. Dr. Magauran succeeded. He was elected
by Propaganda on the 6th March, and confirmed by the Pope
on the 12th 01 same month, 1815. He had been P.P. 01 Bal-
linamore, County Leitrim, on the borders 01 Ardagh, at its
north-western limits. Kindly and cor-dial relations have at all
times existed between the Dioceses 01 Κ11111010 and Ardagh, in
College, and on the mission afterwards, and justly so, for the
Kilmore clergy are a highly respectable, and honest body 01
ecclesiastics. Thus it came about, that on the death 01 Dr.
Oruise, the Ardagh parish priests, not having a suitable member·¹
01 their own body, cast their eyes on the most eligible 01 the
Kilmore clergy, and voted 101 Dr. Magauran, whom they had
known to be in every way suited 101· the high and responsible
office. It is to be regretted there is no written record 01 this
prelate’s life and good works. The writer has taken a good deal
01 pains and· trouble to find something worthy 01 publication
