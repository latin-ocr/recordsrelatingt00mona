But am Ι sure 01 the dispositions Ι appeal to? Can Ι forget
the past Ρ How ungrateful should Ι be 11 ever I should allow
the recollection to escape my mind 01 your noble generosity in
responding to the appeals Ι have already ventured to make to
you. And giving your contributions on these occasigns, did

and as these dispositions still continue, Ι 1001 that Ι am now
appealing to good hearts and willing minds. Oh, who could
say that he has no sympathy 101· so good and holy a work?
Who could single himself out from amongst the thousands‚ and
thousands upon thousands 01 generous and picus souls who 00111-
pose the population 01 this diocese, and say, Ι care not about
the cathedral—-it gives me no concern, Ι care not 11 it never be
finished. God forbid that we should have amongst us, through-
out the entire diocese, even a single individual so insensible to-
. wards an object which engages so much the sympathy 01 us all.
-But will it occur to anyone to say, Ι do indeed feel well dis-
posed in the good 00110ος and 11 Ι could afford it, I would be

happy to contribute, but the trifie Ι can spare is nothing, and

will be nothing missed in the general effort 01 an entire diocese.

How fatal such a view, and at the same time how false? Ι1

such a pretence were good in one case it would be equally so in

Ι 110οᾶ hardly remind you that it is by small sums exten-
sively contributed that large amounts are accumulated. Be-
sides, in a supernatural view, which is the proper view to take,
nothing is small which is given with proper dispositionS. N eed
Ι remind you 01 the widow's mite in the Grospel. “ Rich men
cast their gifts into the Treasury ; a certain poor widow cast in
two brass mites.’' Our Saviour was looking on, and he observed
-—“ Verily I say to you this poor widow had cast in more than
they all. For all these have 01 their abundance cast into the
offerings 01 God3 but she 01 her want hath cast in all the
living that she had.'’—Luke, xxi. 1, Sec. Here, beloved
brethren‚ is our example. In practising the lesson which it
teaches, each 01 us will sound his own heart in the presence 01 Him
who is the “ searcher 01 all hearts.” We will consider the
nature 01 the demand that is made upon us, that “ a house has
been prepared, not 101· man but 101· God.'' Ι1 we have
abundance we will feel that we ought to give out 01 0111· abund-
ance, and 11 we have only the widow's mite we wiH not refuse
even it. Thus every parish contributing according to its means,
and every individual giving what his own spontaneous bounty
will urge him to give, you wiu once more present to heaven the
