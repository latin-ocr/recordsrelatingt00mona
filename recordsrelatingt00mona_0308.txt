DR. OONROY succeeded.

GEORGE M. CONROY was born in 1833, on the lst Januarv
at Dundalk. His parents were highly respected 10 their own
parish and neighbourhood. He came 01 0 Levitical family. He·
received his primary education at Dromisken, and was after--
wards sent to an Intermediate School in Dundalk. In 1848,
he was placed as an alumnus in the Diocesan 0011080 at
Armagh. In all those schools he gave signs of his future-
distinction. In 1850 Archbishop Cullen gave to him first
place at the Annual Concursus, and afterwards sent him to
Propaganda College, Rome. In this centre of learning he-
rose to the highest distinctions, having obtained the degrees
of Bachelor 01 Philosophy and S. Τ. D. Before he had
completed his collegiate training in Rome, Dr. 0111100
was promoted to Dublin, and soon after manifested an especial
interest in the successful management of All-Hallows Missionary
0011080. Wherefore, Dr. Conroy, having completed his studies
at Rome, was appointed a Professor in that College, under the·
Presidency 01 Dr. Woodlock, now the Venerated Bishop of
Ardagh and Clonmacnoise. This event took place in 1857.
He continued to discharge, with striking efficiency, the duties-
of Professor in that Institution until 1866, when he left and
became Secretary to His Eminence Cardinal Gullen. He
also was appointed Chaplain to Mountjoy Prison, and after-
wards became co-Editor of the Ecclesiastical Record, with Dr.
Moran, now Cardinal Moran 01 Sydney. In each and all of*
these offices he rendered distinguished services. In 1871, Dr.
Conroy was called to the Episcopacy in Ardagh, and was-
consecrated in St. Mel's Cathedral on the 11th April.
His Eminence Cardinal 0111100 was the consecrating prelate,
and the Right Rev. Dr. Dorrian preached on the occasion.
The yolmg bishop gave himself up, heart and soul, to the·
arduous duties of his high office. His labours were not con-
fined to his own diocese. His gradually growing fame as a
preacher brought to him many invitations from neighbouring-
prelates and priests to preach on special occasions. The late
Cardinal Franchi was a great friend and admirer 01 Dr.
Conroy's many striking qualities‚ and recommended him to His.
Holiness, as Delegate Apostolic to India, which appointment
the young bishop begged to be excused from acceptiug, on
account 01 the extreme heat of the climate. His lordship was
shortly after sent to Canada on a similar mission. About the=
beginning 01 May, 1877, the Bishop 01 Ardagh left Ireland„
invested with full authority as Apostolic Delegate to Canada.
