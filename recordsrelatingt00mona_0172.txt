ments have been necessarily destroyed, and even although lawfuI
authority should be restored, Memorialists conceive the loss to
be irreparable; for the revenues would not easily be recovered,
and as the profligate principles of rebellion and Atheism, pro-
pagated by the faction which now rules that kingdom, may not
be speedily effaced, they would not expose youth to the conta-
gion of sedition and infidelity, nor their country to the danger
of thus introducing the pernicious maxims of a licentious philo-
sophy. Memorialists, therefore, are apprehensive that it may
be found difficult to supply the Ministry of the Roman Catholic
Church in Ireland with proper clergymen, unless seminaries,
schools, or academies be instituted, for educating the youth
destined to receive Holy Orders, according to the discipline of
their own Church, and under ecclesiastical superiors of their·
own communion ; and they beg leave further to represent, with
all due respect and deference to your Excellency's wisdom, that
said institution would prove of advantage to the nation at large,
and be a matter of great indulgence to his Majesty's subjects
professing the Roman Catholic religion in Ireland.

Whilst sentiments unfavourable to the members of their
communion prevailed, your Excellency's Memorialists were
discouraged from seeking the means of Education in their-
native country 3 but conceiving that the demeanour of the
Roman Catholics has removed such ill opinion, they humbly
hope that the moral instruction of a people who have been
legally authorized to acquire landed property in this country,
and upon whom many other valuable privileges have been
conferred, under your Excellency’s administration and auspices,
may appear to his Majesty's Ministers a subject not unworthy
of his Royal consideration and bounty. Your Excellency’s
Memorialists are confirmed in this hope by the opinion often
ancl publicly expressed by respectable individuals of their Pro-
testant fellow-subjects‚ that it 'would conduce to the public
good to educate the Irish Ecclesiastics of the Roman Catholic
religion within his Majesty's dominions.
