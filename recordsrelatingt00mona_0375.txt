ncollected and placed in a napkin, 'and carried to Antioch, and
preserved asan inestimable treasure left to the Church. Like-
wise‚ after the ‘martyrdom of St. Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna,
who is commended in the “ Revelations,'' and who was a disciple
= of St. John, the Christians who were present at his death, A.D. 147,
“ took up his bones, more precious than the richest jewels and
tryed above g01d‚’' and deposited them where it was fitting, and
probably in some secure depository until they could be honourably
-enclosed in a shrine.

In Ireland, the use of shrines is contemporaneous with the
introduction of Christianity. So great has been the veneration
in which our ancestors held them, that in spite of the wars and
revolutions of so many centurieS‚ a few well authenticated
examples are still to be seen amongst us. And there are many
places in Ireland which have been called Skryne or Skreen,
owing to the bones of some saint having been deposited there in
a shrine. The shrine of St. Columba, per varios casus per tot
discrimina rerum—the chief object for so long a time of the rov-
ing and murderous northmen’s search—was brought from Iona
to Ireland sor safety. Walafridas Strabus thus writes of it :—

“ Ad sanctum venere patrem pretiosa metalla
Reddere cogentes queis sancti sancta. Colombae
Ossa jacent, quam quippe suis de sedibus, arcam
Tollentes tumulo terra posuere cavato
Cespite sub denso gnari jam pestis iniquae
Hanc praedam cupiere Dani.''

In England, Durham and Canterbury possessed the most
celebrated shrines, viz.‚ those of St. Outhbert‚ the Venerable
Bede, and Thomas a Beckett.

By the order of Henry VIII. both were despoiled. When
that of Outhbert‚ an Irish saint, was broken open, the Commis—
sionem, to their amazement, observed the body of the saint
entire and uncorrupt, arrayed in his pontifical vestments. Dis—
inayed, they stopped short, until they learned the king's pleasure.
When it was known, the body was buried beneath the place
where the shrine had been.

’ Scott, following the popular traditions regarding the con-
cealment of St. Cuthbert's reliques in some part of Durham,
wrote the following :—

“ Where his Cathedral huge and vast
Looks down upon the Wear,
There deep in Durham’s Gothic shade
Α His reliques are in secret laid.
But none may know the place
Save his holiest servants three,
Deep sworn to solemn secrecy
Who share that wondrous grace.’'
