ELIAS

succeeded, according to Ware, who has the following state-
mentz—“Elias was Bishop of Clonmacnoise, in the twentieth1
year of King Henry III„ ΑΛ). 1236. For having resigned his
See that year, the Dean and Chapter went to election‚ without
the king-’s licence ; but had that of Maurice FitzGerald‚ Lord
J ustice, by virtue of which they elected Thomas, Dean of
Clonmacnoise. The King upon this issued his Mandatory Writ-
to the Lord J ustice, reciting the misbelaavioum· but, on account
of the poz‘ertgs of the church gave his assent and ordered ‘ that‚'
as soon as the Archbishop of Armagh had certified 1118 metro-
political confirmation, that then the Lord Justice should give
restz'tute‘on of all the lands belonging to the See of Clonmacnoise,‚
of which Elias, late Bishop os Olonmacnoise‚ and predecessor of.
Thomas, was seized on the day of his resignation. So that Elias.
must intervene between Hugh O'Malone and Thomas, or must
be the same person with Hugh, which I consess is not im·-
probable.''
