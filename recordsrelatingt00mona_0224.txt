students who attend lectures at the University of Paris generally
reside in collegeS‚ and in those establishments they are obliged
-to be equally observant of silence, during study hours, as the
students of Maynooth.

Do the students of the Irish College at Paris attend. the
lectures in the University Ρ The Olerioal University, properly
speaking, is not yet organised, and hence they have not yet an
opportunity of attending3 but still there are lectures delivered
by way of continuation of the ancient Sorbonne, and Ι believe
they sometimes attend those lectures.

When you were in the Irish College did you attend any
lecture given not in the 0011686, but in the University Ρ
Whilst I was in the College Ι never attended any lectures given
in the University on clerical subjects; but I attended them be-
fore going there.

Speaking of the times before the Revolution, was it the habit
⁴of the students of the Irish College to attend the lectures given
in the University Ρ It was usual with some of them to attend.

Are the two buildings near to each other Ρ They are con—
venient to each other.

Had the students of the Irish 0011686 any lectures of their
-own distinct from those delivered in the University? After
attending the lectures in the University when they came home
there was another professor whose business it was to see that
they had well attended to the lecture at the University, and to
make them account to him for the duty of the day.

VVas their attendance upon the lectures in the University
confined to the lectures in Theology, or did it extend to the
lectures in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy and other sub-
jects Ρ Ι should think it extended to all.

When you were in Paris were there lectures delivered in
the University upon Natural Philosophy Ρ There were.

Was it the habit of the students in the Irish 0011686 10
attend upon those lectures? It was not habitual with the
students to go, but I sometimes went myself.

Can you form any opinion as to the probable number of
students in the University of Paris itself? As the University
of Paris comprehends the schools of Law, Medicine, and
Theology‚ and many other departments, probably there may be
five or sixsthousand3 Ι should think there is at least that number.

Are there any students or professors living in the building
which is denominated the University Ρ There is no one build-
ing denominated the University in Paris3 but that portion of
the University which was called Sorbonne—and which is a
very extensive building—formerly lodged the professors ;
whether they live there now or not Ι cannot say.
