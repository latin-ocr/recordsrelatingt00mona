himself ‘chiefly to criticism *on history and' art, a Life of
Robespz‘erre, an essay on the Spanish drama of Vega and
Calderon; an exposition of Comte's Positive Philosophy, in Bohn's
scientific series3 a Biographical History of Philosophy, and a
Life of Goethe. Since 1857 he has edited J ohnson's Ohemistrgs
of Oommon Lg'fe, and published the Philosophy of Common Life,
Seaside Stzcclz'es, and Studio-s· of Animal Lffe. Nearly a year ago
he commenced to edit the Fortm'qlztly Review, in which, from
time to time, papers in favour of Positivism occur.

F ellow-worker with Mr. Lewes is Marian Evans, better known
under the name of George Eliot. In 1846, imitating the ex-
amples of Littre and Renan, she contributed her share of labour
towards destroying saith in Christianity‚ by translating Strauss's
Life of Clmtst, and ζ in 1853) F euerbach's Essenoe of Olzrz'stiam'ty.
Besides these works, she published in the Westmmster Review
theologica] articles, animated by the same principles. Under
the name of George Eliot she rose to an ’ eminent position
among novelists, by her &cenes from Olerioal Life, Adam Bede,
and other works. As to the moral and religious purpose of her
works, it is not necessary to say much. When her early works,
published under the name of George Eliot, first became famous,
various conjectures were hazarded by critias, as tothe probable
author. One critic* dwelt upon the testimony she unconsciously
bore to the truth of Catholicism‚ and on the way in which she
brought home to the conscience the doctrine of the Personality
vos God. Against this we have to say that there is no one doc-
trine which she denies more thoroughly than that there exists a
personal God. Her views of religion are those of Go'ethe, who
has been well described as a man of deep religious sentiments,
with complete scepticism on most religious doctrines.

With her, saith is an illusion3 doctrines and creeds are but
names for sentiments, useful only to turn “ feelings into
energies‚” the substance of all religion is the same. And yet
she speaks as if she had saith in Christianity. And in this,
says the reviewer above cited, she is not dishonest. For,
although to the Positivist‚ religious doctrines are only impres-
sions on the imagination, not corresponding with any reality in
the universe, still they are necessary to enable man to turn his
feelings into energies. Hence, the Positivists can enter into the
feelings of others, and to these others speak like believers in
Christianity. A writer in the Westminster Review has said of
her, that she apparently regards creeds “ as being only shells
of different shape and colour, enclosing the fruit of the reli—
gious spirit, common to the human race3 or as so many mental.
