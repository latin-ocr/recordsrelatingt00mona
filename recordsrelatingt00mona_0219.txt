MINUTES or EVIDENCE. 199

But at the same time that he is liable to err in the exercise
of that jurisdiction? Some divines hold that he is liable to err
in every shape ; other divines hold that when he speaks ex
cathedra, that is as the universal Pastor of the Church, and
defining matters of faith, in such cases he is infallible.

Those who hold that he is liable to err may therefore conceive
that a particular Pope may, in particular instances, have
assumed a power as belonging to him in spirituals, which in fact
is not a power in spirituals but in something else P Those who
hold that the Pope is fallible must hold, as the natural con·
sequences of their opinion, that by possibility he may assume
even in spirituals a right which would not belong to him, and
on such occasions would be liable to¹ the correction of the
Universal Church.

In case a Pope should therefore decree a particular article of
doctrine as being an article of faith to be received by all Catholics‚
is it still competent for the individual members of the Church,
without heresy, to consider whether that is a doctrine of faith ἶ)
ἺῩ11611 the Pope proposed any doctrine to be believed, every
individual may, without incurring heresy, examine the truth
or falsehood of such doctrine, until it receives the approbation
of the Church, but this once obtained we are no longer to hesitate
in believinrr it.

You haive said that the power committed to St. Peter and
his successors was of the same nature, and over the same sub-
jects, as that which was exercised by our Saviour himself when
upon earth ; and that this is to be discovered from the revealed
Word of God3 is it competent, therefore, for a member of the
Roman Catholio Church to consider whether the power or
superintendence or jurisdiction exercised by a particular Pope
is conformable to Scripture or not P When a Pope issues a
Ball, no matter what that Bull may regard, a Catholic, without
incurring the note of heresy, may examine whether the Bull in
such case acts conformably with the Scripture or not ; but if it
be confirmed by the tacit consent of the Church, a Catholic would
be no longer at liberty to doubt of its truth, if it regarded faith.

Would it be competent for him to examine whether it re-
garded faith or not? Before the consent of the Church de-
termined it to be of faith, he might freely discuss its merits3
but afterwards he might merely examine it, however, not with
an intention of dissenting.

When you stated that our Lord left to St. Peter, and
through him to the Pope, only such power as our Lord Him-
self exercised‚ your answer had reference to a question whether
he gave him power over the temporal concerns of men. but you
did not thereby mean to say that our Lord gave to St. Peter
