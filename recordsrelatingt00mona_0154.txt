134 mocEsE OF ARDAGH

Catholic WVarden was not afterwards triennially re-eletcted ‘for
life. Warden Blake's administration was short, but not inactlve.
It is to his care and zealous exertions that Galway owes the
erection of the parish chapel in Middle—street, which he com—
menced about the year 1752, the first year of his incumbency,
and which continued the only parochial chapel in the town till
it was taken down in 1833, and another built on the same Slte
by Dr. Browne, the first Bishop of Galway. In· the year 1755,
Warden Blake was promoted. to the bishopric of Ardagh,·be1ng
succeeded in Gralway by the Rev. Francis Kirwan3 and m the
end of 1758, he was translated to the Primatial 800 of All Ire-
land. On the 19th of May, 1761, he held a Diocesan Chapter
at Dundalk, in which some important laws were enacted for the
reform of abuses, especially the repression of intemperance and
of irregularity in the hours and places of public worship, and
against the unjustifiable interference of the laity with the rights
of the bishop in collating parishes and in other acts of episcopal
jurisdiction. In June, 1764, another Diocesan Chapter, or
85711011, sanctioned a new mode of supplying a competent sup—
port for the bishop, and urged, under heavy penalties, the erec-
tion of suitable chapels, or, as they styled them, “ Mass-houses,'’
in every parish by the parish priest. These meetings prove
that, at least during the first six years of his government, Dr.
Blake was regarded as favourably by his clergy as any prelate
could well be who introduced reforms, many of which, beffldes
being departures from old custom, were in themselves onerous.
The acts of these Synods are published here as a partial evidence
of the state of the Catholic Church in Ireland immediately
before the turning part in her modern history.
