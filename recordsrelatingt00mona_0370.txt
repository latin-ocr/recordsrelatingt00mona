fast dying out.'’ Mr. Dungan, a native of Gmnard, but re-
siding at Oopenhagen, established an institution at Granard for
awarding annual prizes to the best performers on the harp.
Seven harpers competed there for his prizes in 1784, and the
contest terminated with a ball, attended by the gentry of the
neighbourhood. For two centuries the penal laws had been
fiercely directed towards the extinction of Irish music, as well
as devotion to the faith. The total extirpation of the Irish
minstrels was especially aimed at. From the earliest times
the Irish had been regarded as a musical people‚ and their
claims to that character have been admitted even by the
foreigner. The harp was the instrument to which they were
most devoted. It was their national emblem also. Hence the
fierce and unrelenting efforts for its extinction. In the tour
of Monsieur de la B. le Gouz, published for the first time in
1653, the following passage occurs :—

“ They (the Irish) are fond of the harp, on which nearly all play, as the
English do on the fiddle, the French on the lute, the Italiaus on the guitar, the
Spaniards on the castanets, the Scotch on the bagpipe, the Swiss on the fise,
the germinis on the trumpet, the Dutch on the tambourine, and the Turks on
t le ageo et.’'

A commentator on the above passage says—

“This reminds one of our own Goldsnfith, when he says: ‘I have drunk
burgundy with the Freneh, hollands with the Dutch, gin with the Swiss;
eaten vermicelli at Naples, and sourcrout in Germany.''

Certainly both these writers were citizens of the world, as
doubtless was also our noble-hearted and generous-handed exile
from Granard, who, from his adopted home at Copenhagen‚
made so patriotic an effort to save our national musical instru-
ment from extinction. Surely a soul of such noble and lofty
aims deserved success.
