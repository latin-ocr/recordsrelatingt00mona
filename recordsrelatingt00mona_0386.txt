³366 1110οΕ811 OF ARDAGH.

inquiries, or rather, most probably, would not have found thisr
cross at all, as Ι 0111 pretty certain Mr. Fahy would have been
beforehand in rescuing it from oblivion and its fallen state. Be
this as it may, the only information that Mr. ‘Oooke succeeded
in gathering at that time regarding it was, that this stone then
so uncared and unnoticed, had in more prosperous and happy
days stood erect beside a crystal spring, which once 80111 forth
its limpid waters 111 1110 old market square of Banagher, adjoin-
ing 1110 churchyard. That spring has ceased 10 flow, and 1110
01088 18 110 longer there.

Mr. Oooke pursued 1118 inquiries, and could not find any
person in 01 0110111 Banagher 10 explain 10 him the meaning of
the carving on the 810110, 01 why 01 011 111101 occasion it was
erected, or on 111101 occasion it 1108 pulled down. After some
years he learned a good deal about it, and the following is his
own description of this very interesting antique :—

“ It 18 formed out of that description 01 greyish-brown sand-
stone, which, when recently taken from the quarry, 18 80 very
8011 08 01111081 to 0111 beneath the pressure of an ordinary knife3
but which becomes of adamantine hardness after being some-
time exposed to the atmosphere. The lower part of this 01088-
shaft was broken off and has been lost. What remains is five
feet long, by one foot two inches in breadth at the top, and one
foot four inches at the bottom. The sculpture on it consists of
three compartments. On the uppermost of these we find a lion
passam, three tailed or 9uived, as a herald would express it.
A, small 11011011 about the place 01 the lion's shoulder was abraded
into the stone when I saw it. This has since been greatly
enlarged.

“ Beneath the lion I have mentioned, and in the same com-
partment with it, is 1110 figure of a bishop on HORSEBACK, and
bearing his pastoral staff as emblematical of his sacred office.
The crosier is of that plain form which indicates antiquity.

‘⁶ In the second compartment is a beast of the decr kind, and
which is proved by the character of its horns to be the red deer
(cervus elephas), an animal now, I believe, nearly extinct in Ire-
land. The poor creature is portrayed as in great pain, its head
being thrown up in an attitude of anguish and distress, whilst
its off or foreleg is found to be entangled in something 1080111-
bling a trap. When I first beheld this stone the deer was quite
perfect, but it has been mutilated by reckless and savage hands
since that day.

“The lowest compartment consists of four naked and ill—pro-
portioned male human figures, arranged around the central point
01 1110 compartment after the manner of spokes in a wheel.
Their legs are hooked together, and the left hand of each figure
