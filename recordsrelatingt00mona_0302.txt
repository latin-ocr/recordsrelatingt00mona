282 mocnsr: or ARDAGH.

you too well to address you in terms of commonplace congratu-
lation. Ι am very sure that to yourself, personally, the burden-
which has been laid upon you will be most unacceptable, and
that your personal happiness would be far better consulted by·
your being left to the quiet of your own community and Con-
gregation. But Ι also know that whatever you may undertake„
in obedience to what is clearly God’s holy will, you will carry
through with a singleness of purpose, which will be at once a
source of peace to yourself‚ and of blessing to those who are-
intrusted to your charge. But my chief object in writing to
yOU, to whom I shall, henceforth, be responsible for a very

heavy trust, is to assure you of the unfeigned satisfaction which
Ι shall have in administering so much of my trust as concerne-
the Diocese of Ardagh, under a prelate whom I respect and
esteem so much, and whose views of the fitness of ecclesiastical
life and character are so entirely in accordance with my own.
Ι need hardly assure you further, my dear Lord, of my hearty
sympathy with you in all that concerns your high office, and

my earnest prayer that God may make it easy and full of
happiness for you.

May I beg to be affectionately remembered to all my friends
in the Irish Oollege, and to Ed. Kelly in particular.

Ever dear Dr. MacCabe,

Your most sincere and faithful friend,

C. W. RusSELL.
