river, at a place called Derry-graney. She was called the
“‘ Sun's brightness.’' Another lady, named “ Grain,'’ was
buried near the town of Antrim, at a place called Carngranny.
Her monument also remains, as Mr. Reeves testifies in the
following words :—“ It consists os ten large slabs raised on side
supportem, like a series of Oromleachs, forming steps, commenc-
ing with the lowest at the north—east, and ascending gradually,
for the length of forty feet, towards the south-west.'' But I
do not find it stated anywhere that a lady of that name was
buried at or near Granard. I therefore infer that ‘⁶ Grain‚''
which is the Irish word for “Sun,” and “Ard‚” an “Emi-
nence,'' were applied to designate the old town of Granard,
owing to its lofty and sunny eminence.* This place, like Tara,
is supposed to have been one of the important stations appro-
priated to the celebration of idolatrous worship before the intro-
duction of Christianity into this country. Granard, as it now
vstands, is bounded on the north-western extremity of its great
wide street by a high artificia] mound, called the “ Moat.”
Before its destruction in 1315, by the Scots, commanded by
Edward Bruce, the old town was situate close to the present
old church at Granard Kill. This old church, standing in the
parochial cemetery‚ was the matria: ‘ecelesia of the parish before
the completion of'the new beautiful Gothic edifice now so grace-
fully topping the hill of Granard, and overlooking not only the
»town but also commanding charmingly picturesque and diver-
sified scenery in more than one neighbouring county. The coup
-ssd’oez‘l from this spot is something to be remembered. St. Mary's,
Granard (so worthily and prudently presided over by the Ven.
Archdeacon O’Flanagan‚ V.G., is not only the matrix eeclesia
-of the parish, but also the chief church of the Deanery, non
tantum ratione officii et altitudinis sed etiam ratione magnifi-
centiae tum externae tum internae. In the days of the old
town's existence, of which traces are still observable in some of
the rich fields‚ equally, perhaps, even more rich than the
pastures of Golden Vale, owned by the much respected widowed
lady of the late lamented William O’Flanagan, Esq.‚ the Moat
stood on the north-eastern side of Granard. It now stands
sentinel—like, a towering bulwark at the north-western side of
the town. Of the age, origin and uses of this large Mound or
Rath, I shall now make a few remarks. In my researches for
evidence sufficient to determine the exact period of its origin I
found none. It is certain, however, that it was in existence when

* According to Leabhar na Huidhre‚ Granard signifies locus amoenus. It
:is to be observed, the present town is not built in Granard, but in Rath—
Cronan. The original site is a lovely spot, and deserves the appellation of
*locus amoenus, bestowed upon it in the “ Tripartite Life.”
