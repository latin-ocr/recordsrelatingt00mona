106 DIOCESE or ARDAGH

have no cognizance whatever. His Excellency excuses himself
for not having furnished Dr. Murray with the Oorrected
Statutes at an earlier day, by stating that the whole attention
of the Government was absorbed in efficiently relieving all the
distress of the Irish poor!

3. The Oorrected Statutes, as they are termed, change
nothing substantial in the Act : can themselves be changed by
any other viceroy‚ and, though passed into law by Parliament‚
would not afford the least protection to Oatholic saith or morals,
as they leave all the appointments of the professors and other
officers to the will and caprice of aheretical monarch. Such are
the flimsy and insulting safeguards which Dr. Ennis and his Grace
of Dublin think quite sufficient to protect our Oatholic youth
and our holy religion in Ireland, against the power, the wealth‚
the bigotry, the proverbial treachery of heretical England. Dr.
Ennis has presented his pamphlet to the Pope and the Oardjnal
Prefect. It ends with a commentary from himself, recom-
mendatory of the Statutes and the Colleges. Of this com-
mentary I may say, in general terms, that it is sophisticaL in-
sulting, lying, and calumnious of the Irish bishops‚ priestS‚ and
people. It states that it is very proper and wise to leave all
the appointments in the hands of the crown, as the Catholic

Catholic religion in that country3 and that it was necessary to
leave the whole direction of the Colleges with the Crown‚ to
guard against the unmeaning stubbornness with which the Irish
Bishops would oppose the plans of every possible Government.

5. That the Government will, and ought to proceed with
the Colleges‚ despite of all episcopal, priestly‚ or lay opposition,
in order to educate the Catholic youth of Ireland in a manner
worthy of the true principles of the Catholic religion.

6. That all the lay Oatholics of Ireland are panting for the
completion of the Oolleges—that they will rush to them in
crowds, profoundly grateful to their generous founders.

7. That the Government bountifully distributes 4;ΕΙΟΟ,ΟΟΟ a
year, chiefly between the Catholic Bishops, for the education of
the poor, gives ι;Ε326,ΟΟΟ annually to Maynooth‚ that too much
lay Catholic confidence in religious matters should not be placed
in such a Grovernment, is too puerile to merit a reply.

8. The commentary closes by stating that in no country in
