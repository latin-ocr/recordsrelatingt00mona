Within a century after the death 01 St. Pandok, writes.
Bishop N icholson, the Irish seminaries had so increased, that
most parts 01 Europe sent their children to be educated here,
and drew thence their bishops and teachers. An unconquerable
love 01 learning dominated the Hibernian intellect and heart,
and led the rulers 01 our colleges in those remote ages to throw
open their doors 10 111011 01 all tongues and races, and give them
not only education, but also books gratis. The result was an
immigration 01 thousands 01 foreigners. The “ Litany 01 SaintS‚”
composed in the eighth century by St. Aengus‚ includes the
names not only 01 Β1110118, Ρ1018, and Saxons, but also 01 Gauls,
Germans, Romans, and Egyptians, all buried in Ireland. The
tomb 01 1110 “ Seven Romans'' at Arran, and the Greek church
at Meath, once served by Greek ecclesiastics, may still be seen.
Amongst the most renowned seminaries 01 111080 distant ages
was Clonmacnoise. The learning 01 118 masters in philosophy
and the sacred sciences passed into a proverb. Thousands 01
students thronged its halls, attracted by their fame. In ther
celebrated Paschal controversy, Clonmacnoise took a leading
and creditable part. Its masters supported St. Cummian and
the Roman system, and displayed the powers not only 01 keen
logicians and subtle metaphysicians, but also astonished their
adversaries by their arithmetical and linguistic erudition. It is
also said to have been famous 101 1110 skill 01118 monks in sacred
psalmody, and to have had some 01 the best choir-masters 111
Ireland. In other departments 01 learning it was still more
famous. In the 110111 01 111811 annalists and high above them
all must be ranked Tigemach, Abbot 01 Clonmacnoise and
Roscommon as well. Able and distinguished critics‚ such as
Dr. O'Conor, assert that 110 country 111 Europe can boast 01 an
historian 01 equal antiquity, learning, and judgment with
Tigernach. “ No chronicler,'' writes this learned author, “ more
ancient than Tigernach can be produced by the Ν 011110111
nations. Neslor, the father 01 Russian history, died in 11133
Snorro, the father 01 Icelandic history, did not appear until a
century after Nes10r3 Kadlubeck, the first historian 01 Pohznd,
died in 1223 3 and Stierman could not discover a serap 01 writing
in all Sweden older than 1159.'' Tigernach was 01 1110 Murray
race 01 Connaught, 01 which the O'Connors were the 011101 sept.
He is styled by the “ Annals 01 Innisfallen” a ‘⁶ saoi, 01 (100101,
111 wisdom, learning, and oratory,’' and the same authority, as
well as the “ Chronicon Scotorum‚'' records his death at the year*
