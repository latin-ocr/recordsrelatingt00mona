rain and storm, through summer sunshine, generation 81181·
generation 01 1118111, 111818 they lived and prayed, and at last
laid down and died.'’ Most fervent among these austere men
was our St. Kyran, who made 01 1118 innocent body a martyr 01
penance.. As day followed after day, and week after week, and
month 81181· 111011111, 101 seven long years, he ceased not to sacri-
fice his will by minutest obedience, his body by severe labour‚
his repose by incessant prayer; and this with the fiinty rock
101 1118 bed, with coarse and scanty food, in poor attire, exposed
to 11081 and sun, buffeted by wind and snow. And as he was a
miracle 01 humility and 01 1181181108, 80 8180 was he a miracle 01
sweetest charity. As his penitential life tells eloquently 01 1118
1ον8 101 God, so the story 01 1118 parting from his brethren‚ when
he was called away from Arran to Olonmacnoise‚ as related
in the ancient Life 01 St. Euda, is a proof 01 1118 loving heart
towards men. As the boat that was to carry him to the banks
01 1118 Shannon was spreading its sails to the breeze, St. Kyrau
came slowly down 110111 1118 beloved cell, weeping and sur-
rounded by his weeping brethren. Tenderly his gaze lingered
on each familiar sanctuary, as he passed onwards to the beach‚
and there, kneeling down, he asked‚ for the last time, the
blessing 01 1118 father 01 1118 80111. Ι11 sign 01 1118 charity that
filled their hearts, and 01 1118 brotherhood they had contracted
between themselves and those who were to come 81181 them, a
cross was erected on the spot, and the two saints said: “ WVhoso-
ever in after times shall break the loving bond 01 11118 0111
brotherhood, shall not have share in our love on earth, nor in
our company in heaven.'' N ear to where that 01088 stood, a
church was erected to commemorate the virtues 01 St. Kyran,
as the perfect Religious That church I have visited and found
a ruin. For centuries it told the history 01 St. Kyran's reli-
gious perfection3 and now that its stones are scattered, and its
altar made desolate, would it not be a reproach to Irish Oatholics
11 they were to allow to perish‚ 101 ever, the memories it was
set up to record. From such a reproach the church we have
dedicated to-day has saved us. These new walls take up the
testimony 01 111888 old ones, in their decay, and tell us 01 1118
perfect monk who toilsomely earned, in Arran, the merits that
were to enrich Olonmacnoise. Here to-day we set up once again
the cross which Enda and Kyran erected in Arran, as a pledge
01 brotherhood between themselves and those who were to come
81181· them. And by a sweet providence 01 God, and as 11 to
declare this church heir to the office 01 that 110111 which
thirteen hundred years separate it, the Bishop who dwells
nearest to St. Enda's Arran has come to Clonmacnoise to-day
to join at the foot 01 that 01088, 111 loving brotherhood and com-
