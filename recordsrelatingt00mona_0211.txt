‘no means binding, but, on·the contrary, to be considered as an
<abomination in the sight of God. ψ

Supposing that the Emperor had entered into a contract
with John Huss that the Church should not declare that heresy
which really was heresy, would you not consider that that con-
tract was a void contract P—If the Emperor had entered into
any such contract, he would have encroached upon the exclusive
rights of the Ohurch, and, in that case, the Ohurch would have
the power to pronounce that the contract was illicit and void.

Do you understand that the passage of the Oouncil which
has been referred to means what you have stated last ?—I do.

Will you have the goodness to read from the Tract de
Ecclesia, p. 320, the passage beginning with “ sacrosancta”?—
·“ Sacrosancta Synodus, etc. . . . quia non-nulli nimis intelli-
gentes aut sinistrae intentionis vel forsan volentes sapere plus
quam oportet nedum regiae magistati, etc. . . . et quod decuit
‘regiam magistatem.'' (Vide Delahogue, Tr. de Ecclesia.)

Will you have the goodness to state in what sense you
understand that passage ?—After reading that passage, I have
nothing to change in the substance of my former answers,
because, as I have already stated, the Church claims the exclu-
2sive right of judging in spiritual matters, and in exercising
that right she by no means interferes with the right she allows
in secular princes to judge in secular matters3 and, therefore,
in the same manner as the Council would not pretend to inter-
fere with the rights of the Emperor in any temporal concerns‚
vin like manner does it insinuate, in the words just quoted, that
‘the saie-conduct granted by the Emperor to John Huss could
not licitly interfere with the rights of the bishops, or prevent
them from judging and condemning the abominable doctrine of
that heresiarch ; Ι must add, that many critics doubt the
authenticity of this canon. It was not published for many
years after the Oouncil had been held, nor is it found in any of
the first editions of the acts of that assembly.

You are aware that it is necessary to put the questions by
which you have been interrogated for the purpose of giving to
you, who hold so important an office in the Oollege of May-
nooth, an opportunity of distinctly stating the Roman Catholic
saith upon the matter to which the question referred, and not
at all with the view of imputing to you the holding of any of
those doctrines which you disclaim upon cath, and from holding
which Roman Catholics have been publicly acquitted even by
persons whose political opinions may be considered as opposed
10 them ?—1 feel pleasure in answering any question that may
tend to make known the honest but sometimes misrepresented
principles of Catholics.
