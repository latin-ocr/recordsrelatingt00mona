concerning that Council is, that John Huss renewed m Germanv*
the errors cof Wiokliffe‚ which errors were, that persons who lost
grace—that is, persons who were not in a state of grace—nov
longer belonged to the Ohurch, and that whatever they did was..
in itself bad; that consequently, when kings or sovereigns of
any kind were no longer in a state of grace, as being wicked,
vicious, and bad men, according to his doctrine, subjects were no
longer bound to obey them. This doctrine naturally gave alarm
to the Emperor Sigismund, who, in unison with the then existing
Pope, had the Council of Constance convened3 and, when the
Council was convened, that John Huss, who was already excom-—
municated and already denounced as a heretic, appealed to that
Council. In appealing to the CounciL he was afraid of some
parties in Germany which had been raised against him by his
doctrine, and, in order to avoid any violence that might be⁴
offered to him, he applied for a safeguard to come to the Council,

which-„was given to him, for the express purpose of arriving safe at η
the Council. He did so; and, in appealing to the Oouncil, as I

apprehend‚ he openly said that, if convinced of heresy at the-
Oouncil, he would abide the punishments that were to be inflicted

on heretics. It was decreed at the Oouncil that he was a heretic,

and I am sure that was plain enough3 and, after, having thus

decreed‚ they left the rest to the secular power, saying: “ We have

found this man guilty of heresy contrary to our saith ; we have>

¹ nothing more to do with him.'' Then as the doctrine which he

taught and which the Gouncil qualified with the act of heresy, and
was not simply so, but also clashed with the temporal rights of
the Emperor, it appears that he was consigned to the magis-
trates of Oonstance, who thought proper to burn him; that
these magistrates burned him for differing from us in doctrine>
is by no means certain. It is generally thought that they
burned him as a rebel, and not as a heretic; because, as he
taught that kings who got out of a state of grace had no longer
any claim upon the allegiance of their subjects, that alarmed
the kings of the different States, and, in order to put a stop to
the propagation of any such rebellious doctrine, they punished
him with death. I cannot allow that the Council had anything
to do with the burning of John Huss. As it has been said also
that that Council would seem to authorise the doctrine that
Catholics were not obliged to keep saith with heretics, I must
deny the fact with respect to the CounciL and I must assert that
it never taught such a doctrine3 and even though any Council—
I do not speak of canonical Councils—but iso any assembly of
bishops were to teach such a doctrine, we would not be obliged
to abide b it.

Wouldir you not consider such conduct a horrible offence
