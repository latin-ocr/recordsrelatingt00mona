›sSchooL but no Intermediate SchooL unless indeed they sacrificed
their conscience and went to the Ranelagh‚ where no religious
instruction, save what is hostile to our faith may be obtained.
That grievance no longer exists in St. Mary's. Dr. Woodlock
bought out the interest of E. Gleeson, Esq.‚ M.D., J .P.‚⁹l÷ in his
beautiful mansion and gardens adj oinin g St. Mary's Ohurch, and
there established the Marist Brothers. They constitute an im-

portant centre of Intermediate training. They may not be judged
by statistical results, so far as their Athlone teaching is con-
-cerned, for they are only a year or so there, and having to work
on raw material it is premature to expect anything to be placed
*in favourable contrast with other Intermediate Schools of several
¹previous years' standing. But this much may be truthfully
,affirmed‚ that in Sootland the same Institute of the Marist Bro-
thers carried off last year 86 per cent. results at the South Ken-
sington Science and Art Department Examinations, as against 46
per cent. won by all the other competing schools in Scotland. In
England they have been nearly as successful. In France and
Australia it is the same. We may therefore expect similar
results in Athlone. This is one of Dr. Woodlock’s special
works. Ι 0111 aware of other great projects now engaging the
most serious attention of Dr. Woodlock regarding Clonmacn oise3
but I am not at liberty to write more at present than that they
have reference to the roofing of King Melaghlin's Ohurch there,
to be used as a Mortuary Chapel‚ in which the funeral service
may be performed according to the ritual, and prayers offered
for the old kings, chieftains, middle class, and poor interred
therein, according to the intention of the founders of the
>churches. Furthermore, there is some probability of areligious
order of considerable eminence‚ not only in our own, but other
-·countries, establishing a novitiate there, and retreat house for
-our clergy, and thus renewing the old glories of the place. A
projected new convent for the Marist Sisters, already residing
. at Carrick-on-Shannon‚ the capital of Leitrim Oounty, is amongst
Dr. Woodlock’s works. It shall be commenced this spring, on
a healthy and picturesque eminence‚ gently rising up from the
-Shannon, just outside the town. It is a pressing want, for the

devoted sisters 01 that teaching institute in Carrick are very in· ,

-2conveniently housed indeed. Doubtless, an intermediate school
101· boys, conducted by the Marist Brothers 01 001110 equally
efficient teaching body will follow, for this important town 01
Carrick-on-Shannon should be supplied with such schools. But
Dr. Woodlock made his Cathedral at Longford the principal

’ * The owner 01 that prosperous factory called the Athlone or Shannon
'NVoollen Factory.
