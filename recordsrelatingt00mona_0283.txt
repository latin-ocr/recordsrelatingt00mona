DEATH or THE Mosr REv. DR. KILDUFF.

Throughout every district in Ireland this sad announce-
ment will be read with profound sorrow. The amiable, the
learned, the pious, and exemplary Bishop of Ardagh is no
more. Shortly after two 0 'clock yesterday, the good prelate
resigned his pure spirit into the hands of his Creator, displaying
‘ to the last that holy zeal, ardent piety, patience, and resigna-

great solemnities of the 29th instant, when the eighteen hun—
dreth anniversary of the martyrdom of SS. Peter and Paul would
be commemorated. But as the time drew near when he was to
have taken his departure for the Eternal Gity, he was stricken
with mah 0²nant typhus fever, which he caught while ministering
to the destitute poor, amongst whom, like his Divine Master, 110
wished to be. All that medical science could accomplish was
done to save the life of one so universally beloved and held
in such deep veneration, but to no avail, as the dread malady
increased in violence until tired nature was overcome‚ and the
sainted prelate passed away, attended by all the consolations of
the faith of which he was, in precept and example, so zealous a
minister, and in the full possession of his vigorous and mascu-
