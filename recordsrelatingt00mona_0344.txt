He received his preliminary education at Granard, there being
in it at that time a classical school of some note. In 1832 he
entered St. Sulpice, Paris. There he remained for seven years,
during which period he obtained high distinctions in his various
classes, and favour with his superiors on account of his good
conduct. Towards the end of 1839, he left Ireland for the
Trinidad Mission in West India, and having arrived there was
appointed Vicaire or QG. in the Port of Spain, the capital of
the island. About two years afterwards, he was promoted to
the Diocesan College of St. George, and appointed its President.

. In that position he remained until he was promoted to the office

and dignity of Cure or P.P.‚ and V.G. of the Port of Spain.

In 1850, this Vicariate was divided, and the Port of Spain
was made an Archiepiscopal See. Roseau having been separated
from it, was erected. an independent diocese, and Dr. Monahan
was appointed its first bishop. He was consecrated in the
Cathedral of Trinidad, by Archbishop Smyth, in 1850. He re-
sided at Roseau until 1852, the year of Archbishop Smyth's
death. Soon after his death, Dr. Monahan was appointed
administrator os the archdiocese which he governed for more
than two years. ⁴

“During that period,'' writes the Very Rev. Canon Forde
(who was at that time a Priest of Trinidad, and President of St.
George’s College there), “he was beloved by all his subjects,

and especially by his clergy. He got more favours and privileges
from the Governors of the islands than any other bishop in his

position was at all likely to have obtained. He had several
parishes established (a bonum of much value there, where the
priests were paid by the State), and new churches erected by
aid of grants of money, advanced by the Government of Trinidad.
He officiated as celebrant of the High Mass on the days of the
funeral and Month's Memory of the Most Rev. Dr. Smyth. A
more dignified prelate in his pontificals I have never seen.
Archbishop Murray, of Dublin, was the nearest to him my eyes
ever looked on. He was most kind and loving to his priests ancl
people, and more like one of themselves, by reason of his gentle
and unassuming manner, than their bishop. It was confidently
expected that he would have been appointed Archbishop of Tri-
nidad, but a section of the French Olergy objected to him on
account of his nationality. Their views prevailed unfortunately‚
at Rome, as subsequent events too clearly proved. His early
death was a great calamity‚ in fact, a loss to the Church in
Trinidad, from which she has not fully recovered to this day.
