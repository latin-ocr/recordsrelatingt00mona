APPENDIX. 385

invited to a εοίνὲε by an English nobleman. Much mischief
may be done, but God, who has preserved Ireland up to the
present, will, I trust, keep His protecting hand still on her.
After the repeal of the Penal Laws in England, I suppose the
Pope cannot refuse an ambassador, and I dare say the present
Ministry will not fail to send one. If the Bishops in Ireland
were united, his influence would be counteracted ; but if we be
divided at home, we shall fall an easy prey to our enemies. It
would be well that these matters were discussed at the meeting
of the Bishops.

Your obedient servant,

MY DEAR Docron Ovum,

This day's post brings to me your much valued
letter of the 22nd February, and that of the 20th J anuary also
reached me in due time. Nothing can be more consoling to
me than to receive such proofs of the Pope’s feelings in my
regard, as he condescendingly gives in this letter, which you
have forwarded. May God long preserve his sacred person for
the protection and furtherance of our holy religion.

At our last meeting Ι had the honour of bringing before
the prelates almost all the topics which formed the object of
our deliberations. The chief of those topics were : the present
system of N ational Education, the contemplated Poor Laws,
combination among the lower classes, and the Belgian ques-
tion. On the principles and operations of the Education
System there was a difference of opinion3 but I succeeded in
putting the whole of the bishops on the alert‚ and produced
such proofs as convinced all that, unless well watched, the edu-
cation, as now carried on, was likely to undermine the authority
of the Catholio clergy, and ultimately to introduce either posi-
tive error-s, or “ Indifferentism.''

As to the Poor Laws, the prelates were also divided. For
my own part, I look upon that measure as a daring conspiracy
of the landlords against the poor of Ireland, tending to degrade
and demoralise the people, and to withdraw them from the just
influence of the clergy, whilst it affords them almost no bodily
relies. On the subject of Combination we would have published

a j0int Pastoral, but that we feared the Tories of Eggland
