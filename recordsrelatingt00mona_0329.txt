POSITIWSM. 309

‘ceive only matter3 hence, he concludes, matter i's the only
reality. Hence scientific investigation was reduced by him to
the doctrine qf bodies, that is, of their eoeistence and olzanqes.
‘The doctrine of bodies includes “the knowledge of all pheno-
mena, in relation to their probable causes, and of all possible
causes, as known from their observed effects.'’ In the heat of
the controversies excited by the philosophy of Hobbes, John
Locke became convinced that the disputants were travelling by
.a wrong road ; that the first thing to be done was, not to analyse
things or doctrines to their simplest elements, but to investigate
‘the faculties of the mind, in order to see what obj ects lie within
‘its reach, and what beyond it. Hence, the famous Essay on
'the Human Understandiny. We cannot here stay to show how
this work leads to materialism. Enough for our present purpose
‘to show to what use Locke’s principleS‚ without his materialism,
have been put in the hands of a school of thinkers of our own
day. This modern school attempts to show by metaphysical
*analysis‚ “that every notion springs from the senses as the
original channels through which the whole material of thought
has been supplied.” The leader of this school is Mr. James
Mill, in his Analysz's qf' the Plzenomena of the Haman Mmd.
Mr. John Stuart Mill, although he does not pledge himself to
:any metaphysical system, also belongs to this school.

In this sketch of the sensational school of philosophy there
mre some broad and deeply-marked lines which it will bc of im-
portance to point out more carefully to the reader. From the
fundamental idea, that the sensations are the basis of our
knowledge, it was easy to pass, once the analytic method was
established, to an exaggerated estimato of the value of outward
-observation of phenomena. This state of mind, acted on by
Locke’s doctrine concerning the proper limits of the intellectual
faculties, ever tended more and more to confine scientific inves-
”tigation to the bare existence of phenomena. All these features
2are to be recognised again in the Positive Philosophy, which we
shall now proceed to set forth.

M. Oomte begins by taking a comprehensive survey of the
rstate of the intellectual world as represented in European civili-
zation. He finds human knowledge to be in an utterly dis-
‚jointed state, Conflicting systems of philosophy divide the
:schools; contradictory religions are multiplied in the churches.
What one philosophy or religion asserts is refuted by another.
A twofold cause of this intellectual confusion presents itself
to his thoughts. “The human mind may be searching for
*truth beyond the legitimate region of its actual knowledge3 or
:it may not take a sufficiently comprehensive view of that truth
which really does lie within its grasp.'’ A true philosophy
