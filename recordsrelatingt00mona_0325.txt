one sense, and in one sense only, they are not Atheists. In
what sense? Inasmuch as Atheism professes to explain the
origin and destination 01 the universe, while the Positivists
refuse to consider the question at all. Their highest authority
tells us that “ even considered under the purely scientific aspect,
Atheism only constitutes a very imperfect emancipation, since
it tends to prolong indefinitely the metaphysical stage by its
ceaseless pursuits 01 new solutions 01 theological problems,
instead 01 pushing aside all such problems as essentially inacces-
sible.''*

We now pass to what touches us more nearly, namely‚ the
Positivist School in England.

The enormous spread 01 infidelity in England may be mea-
sured by the extent 01 infidel literature there published. The
supply, especially in such matters as this, is created and regu-
lated by the demand. 01 Combe's constitution ochm, a work
of materialistic tendency, and based on a denial 01 Providence‚
more than eighty thousand copies issued 110111 the English press.
The total annual issue 01 immoral publications amounts to
twenty-nine millions. In 1851 1110 purely infidel Press in
London issued more than twelve millions 01 publications; the
issues 01 avowed Atheism during the same period being more
than six hundred and fifty thousand. All this is exclusive 01
newspapers.†

We need not say how much Rationalism in its critical aspect
has gained ground in the country whose Established Ohurch
has supplied the writers 01 1110 Essagss and Reviews. But Positiv-
ism, in particular, has struck root far and wide in the English
mind. Dr. Tullock tells us that ‘⁶ Positivism, within the
last quarter 01 a century, has become an active and even fashion-
able mode 01 thought, and nowhere more so than among
certain literar-y and intellectual circles in England. So far as
it is a philosophy, it is adapted to the common understanding,
and falls in fitly with the scientific and social tendencies 01 1110
times; while it has received a noted impulse from certain
English writers 01 great ability.'' As far back as 1838 11 was
noticed by Sir David Brewster in the Eclzffnhmfflz Rem'ew. Miss
Harriet Martineau condensed into two English volumes the six
volumes 01 1110 0011150, 06111118 from her own stores some spite-
ful remarks against theologians. But, 01 all others, Mr. Lewes
became the apostle 01 Positivism in England. His literary

labours have been numerous and varied. He began with
Ranthorpe‚ a novel (1845) ; between 1845 and 1857 110 devoted

’ἒ Discourse on the ensemble of Positivism.
