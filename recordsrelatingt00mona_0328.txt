theories long since familiar can be established, how much 01
their characteristics does it retain, and what has it added from
its own stores ⁸?

Positivism belongs of right to the sensational philosophy,
and preserves the leading features of its parent school, The-
primary elements 01 οΠ our knowledge are three in number,
and philosophical systems* differ one from the other, according·
as they hold up one or the other of these three as 1110 chief or·
sole element whence our ideas are derived. The three clement s-
are: (1) the idea 01 our own individual existence3 (2) the idea
01 nature, of things that are not ourselves; and (3) the idea of'
1110 Absolute or Eternal. The system which takes for its basis-
the first 01 111080, dwells especially upon those striking
facts 01 our consciousness which are our sensations, through
which, as through a channel, comes much of the materials--
01 our thought. Thus was formed the school of sen· ν

the inherent powers 01 1110 individual mind, upon which they

the Pantheism of Spinosa, Schelling‚ and others. Sensationalism,
Idealism, and Pantheism represent, therefore, the main currents-
of the philosophica] tendencies which have moved mankind.

Modern sensationalism received its impetus from Bacon,
in whose system 01 analysis outward observation held the chief'
place, the importance 01 abstract ideas being made to yield to·
that 01 1110 study of external phenomena. In the inductive
philosophy experience was made the principal part. Not that
the Baconian spirit was so wedded to empirical research as 1οι
leave no place for metaphysica] analysis. On the contrary, by
endeavouring to point out a philosophia prima, and by calling
upon its followers to seek out the forms 01 things, its influence-
