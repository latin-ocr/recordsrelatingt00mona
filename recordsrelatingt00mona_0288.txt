The campanile, which was designed by Mr. John Burke, is
one of the most exquisite things of its kind to be found in the
three kingdoms‚ and gives to the cathedral an air of chaste and
solemn beauty calculated to evoke the warmest expressions of
admiration. To the right, the Diocesan College of St. Mel was
to be seen in all its quiet beauty, in the centre of the heaving
meadow land from which it rises, also the fine schools and
the convent to which Ι have alluded. It would be hard to
give a just idea of the grand and impressive appearance of the
interior of the cathedraL which was crowded to the doors in
every portion set apart for the laity. The long line of stone
pillars, from which twelve arches at each side spring, and
dividing the aisles from the nave, looked grand and massive, as
did also the majestic arched decorated ceiling, and superb
circular apse above and behind the high altar and sanctuary,
which were draped in deep mourning, and bore the emblems
of mortality and redemption. The side windows were covered

Dr. KeHy, Bishop of Derry ; the rest of the Irish Bishops
were in Rome· Representatives of the Olergy of all the
neighbouring Dioceses were present, and some from Dioceses
remotely distant. The grand old Gregorian music was sung
with greater excellence and feeling than Ι had ever heard
before. At the conclusion of the ceremonies within the church,
the Lord Bishop of Derry pronounced the absolution of the
dead, and the remains of the deceased bishop were borne from
the cathedral on the shoulders of four of the clergy, amidst the
tears and lamentations of the immense congregation. The
¹remains having been placed in a hearse and four, bearing
white plumes, the funeral procession was formed, under the
-direction of Mr. Alfred Waller, Denzille-street, to whom the
