Mos'r Hom( ἘΑΤΗΕΕ,

We, the Bishop, Clergy, and people of the Diocese of
Ardagh and Clonmacnoise‚ prostrate at the feet of your Holiness,
beg to testify our sineere attachment and profound veneration
for your sacred person, and our heartfelt sympathy under the
most cruel Wrongs, inflicted by designing and evil minded
men on your paternal and benevolent heart. The trials to which

ration and deep affection of all your faithful children, and of
none more than of your faithful and devoted clergy and people
of the Diocese of Ardagh and Olonmacnoise. Our hearts have
been stung with the most poignant grief at witnessing the unjust
and sacrilegious efforts made by misguided and evil disposed
persons, to alienate from its lofty and sacred purpose the patri-

ing the peace and security vof your time-honoured dominions.
We are no less surprised than grieved‚ to learn that, amongst
those who sympathise With, and openly abet the rebels, to your
mild and beneficent rule, are certain English statesmen who,
whilst ready to suppress with dread severity every attempt at
insubordination in the dependencies of Great Britain, have
become the unscrupulous abettors of resistance to your legit-
imate authority, and of the cause of anarchy and treason in
your temporal dominions. These embittered enemies of our
Holy Religion, having a thousand times suffered defeat in their
sacrilegious attacks on the Oatholic Ohurch, have wickedly de-
vised this new mode of warfare, in the vain hope that by robbing
your Holiness of your temporal sovereignty they might succeed
in weakening and ultimately destroying your spiritual authority.
But in vain do they rage and plan their devices against the
Lord‚ and against His earthly Vicar ; He that dwelleth in the
Heavens shall laugh them to scorn. The Lord shall deride
them. Yes, most Holy Father, we take the liberty of respect-
fully assuring your Holiness‚ that on this head we have no fear
for the result of their impotent attacks. Though the worst
passions and direst efforts of wicked men be aroused and
levelled against the Rock of ages ; though heresy and infidelity
spend all the envenomed shafts of their malignant hate against
the Church founded on Peter; yet will they only betray their
own helpless impotency, since God’s Word, unchangeable as.
God himself, has given us the infallible assurance that the
