THE FAMINE IN 1848.

In a letter addressed by Dr. O’Higgins to Dr. Oullen, at
*that time Rector of the Irish College, Rome, and dated from
Ballymahon, l9th May, 1847 ; amongst other important matters,
the Bishop referred to the famine then decimating Ardagh.

'The following extract is from the letter 2—-

“Of course, you have some idea from the papers of the
state of the poor of Ireland. N ever was any part of the globe
‘visited with so prostrating destitution. It would sicken your
heart to see those of our people who, up to this, have escaped
death. Persons of twenty years of age appear to be bending
under old age, and, in many instances, are become shameless
rand idiotic from want of every kind.

This Diocese is composed of portions of seven counties:
Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon‚ Sligo, King's County, Cavan,
-and County Meath. We thus, of necessity, participate most
deeply in all the wretchedness of the country. All our pro-
prietors‚ with scarcely any exception, are absentees; and our
condition is truly forlorn. We have in this Diocese five poor
hoecses, and the average deaths in the week are beyond 100
persons in each. In some instances, particularly in Leitrim‚
whole families are discovered to be dead in their cabins, by the
stench that proceeds from their putrid bodies! The dead are
frequently buried in bogs, cabbage plots‚ and even in the
houses where they die l The most part of the land of Leitrim
will be untilled this year, and the Oatholics will, I fear, before
long, have nearly all disappeared from death or emigration.
The clergy must soon be as wretched as the people. I go about
‘through the most destitute districts on Sundays, and sometimes
in two chapels on the same day, preaching resignation to the
will of God, and giving what other consolation I can3 and in
my endeavours I am assisted by the priests who, without excep-
tion, have identified themselves with their flocks. Fever,
dysentry, and starvation are everywhere. Grod alone can
see the end. '

Yours, ἂψ,

Very Rev. Dr. Cullen.
