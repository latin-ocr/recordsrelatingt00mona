BOUNDARIES OF ARDAGH DIOCESE. 11

narrative regarding St.E1-ard‚ with this important difference,
viz„ that he, after several years of most fruitful and 6(1115 1118
805* ernment in the Diocese of Ardagh, set out, accompanied 115
1118 two brothers and the nineteen other associates, already
referred to, to visit the tombs of the Apostles

Hav 1118 61115 ed at Rome, the Sup reme Pontiff 1equested 111111
to go to Germany and there 11166611 the Gospel. This is a
NOTABLE omssmN in Ware’s biographical sketch of our 861111.
Ware adds, “ the first whom we find to have written the life of
Erard was one Paul, a monk, in the eleventh century.’' The
second who wrote it was Conrad, of Montpelien in France about,
the beginning 01 the fourteenth century. To these may be added
the several accounts given of him in the ancient and modern
Breviaries of Augsburg, Ratisbon‚ and Wurzburg, which
chiefly follow one or other of these authors. But some learned
German writers have put this matter in a plainer light; and,
although they have not cleared up all the difficulties, yet hav e
said enough to give us grounds 101 6 probable opinion on
the matters in dispute, which are chiefly these: lst. The
country of St. Erard. Qndly. Of what See 116 was bishop. 3rdly.
In what age he flourished. lst. It is almost universally ad-
mitted that he was a native of Ireland. Genem Swtus, m Seotm
natus, is the usual phrase among the learned writers regarding
the country of Erard. Scotia was then synonymous with Ireland.
The Bollandists gather together the opinions of the several
learned writers on this subject and give as the most pro-
bable opinion “that he was a 8601 01 Ireland.'' Aventin
was the first who started a contrary opinion3 but being a
man 01 110 161116 for veracity‚ had but few followers.
There is, however, a difficulty arising from the expres-
sions of 801116 01 these writers. Paul, for example. Paul,
above mentioned, observes “ he was Narbonensis Gentili-
tate‚ Nervius Civilitate‚ Genere Scoticus.'' From whence
one may be induced to judge that he was born at Narbon in
Gaul, 01 Ι11811 parents, and educated among the N ervu a people
of Belgio Gaul. His brother, Η5 dulph, is said by an ancient
writer eof hes Life which the Bollandists 11656 published, to be,
N 15 61 morum ortus genere, and 1n another life, Ne1 riorum ortus
genere. But, it must be observed, that when foreigners meet
with our uncouth Irish names they are often under difficulties
to express them in proper Latin words. On this account
Aventin and 1118 followers have been misled. We must not,
therefore, seek after Narbon, in Gaul, as the place of our
Bishops birth. Some 01 the German Legends point out that
place 1n our own country —Narbonoe in Scotia 1161118, two of
them 61111168815Γ 865*. Narbon, therefore, 01· rather, Harbone,
