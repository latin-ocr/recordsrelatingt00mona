countries and other periods and different circumstances in the
history of the government of the Church. That his appoint-
ment was most fortunate and fruitfuL subsequent events will
clearly show. ’

After his elevation to the priesthood, but before his con-
secration as bishop, he remained at Rome by the request and
advice of Dr. Cullen, Rector of t'he Irish College, to teach the
alumni of that seminary Moral Philosophy. For sixteen
months he discharged the duties of professor with great energy
and effect. On the 4th November, 1848, he left Rome and
came to Paris and entered the House of Missions of St. Vincent
de Paul, St. Lazar, Rue de Sevres, where he remained for five
months. During that period he acquired a great facility in
speaking the F rench language. About the end of April, 1849,
he left F rance and came to Ireland and joined his old friends
the Vincentians at Castleknock, where he was appointed Pro-
fessor of Rhetoric and the Sacred Scriptures. In the discharge
of the duties of that important office he was engaged for one
year, at the end of which he expressed a wish to go with the
fathers and give Missions to the poor in different parts of the
country. In that meritorious and laborious occupatiori he con-
tinued during the remaining period of his sojourn with the Vin-
centianS, whose vows, he himself tells us, in his Autobiography,
he never made although frequently invited to do so. The Sees
of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise having become vacant by the
death of Dr. O'Higgins, an election was held at Ballymahon‚
and the parish priests nominated the Very Rev. Dr. Dawson as
dignissimus, Dr. Smyth, P.P.‚ Ballnahown, dignior, and Dr.
O’Beirne, dignus.

In some months after, to the surprise of many, and especially
of Dr. Kilduff himself, the Pope appointed F ather Kilduff
Bishop of Ardagh. Dr. Kilduff used his best influence to
escape the burden, but was unsuccessful. He was told it was
better for him to regard the voice of Rome as the voice of God
in his regard.
