understood as spiritual mother ; we may understand it in
that sense. St. Mel is the patron Saint of the Diocese of
Ardagh. The ruins of his church are still to be seen near
the village of Ardagh, which lies about five miles south-
east of the town of Longford. The style is nearly Cyclopem),
the greater number of the stones being almost eight feet long·
The doorway is perfect, but remarkably low. The church itself
was never large. Not far from these ruins now stands a
beautiful and graceful Gothic church‚ erected by the present
distinguished pastor, Very Rev. Canon ReynoldS, P.P., V.F.
The great qualities of head and heart, which made him so re-
markable in his classes at Maynooth, and afterwards as Presid ent
of St. Mel's College, are to some extent illustrated in this
beautiful church. It is a source of deep regret to the many
admirers of his great talents and other endearing qualities that
the heavy labours inseparable from the erection of so large and
costly a church have impaired his once powerful and robust
constitution. SS. Rioch and Munis‚ the travelling companions
and co-labourers of St. Patrick‚ are said to have been brothers
of St. Mel. Our annalists also state that St. Mel received the
gift of prophecy. This was exemplified in St. Bridget's case.
He foretold the greatness and sanctity of that holy virgin before
her birth. Some time after her birth he administered to her the
sacrament of Confirmation ; and afterwards gave the reli·
gious veil to that youthful spouse of Christ. A great intimacv
thus arose between SS. Bridget and Mel, which lasted as long
as his life. St. Mel wrote the Acts of St. Patrick, his maternal
uncle, who survived him. Ware relates that fact in the follow-
llggrggglsfirst {ishlblglofdfleielbffiii‘ivli gf ἓξᾶξὲὶῗᾞςξοξέ ᾶῇῗοέξῗὲ
the virtues and miracles of St. Patrick‚ who was then living.
St. Mel died at Ardagh in the year 488, or, according to the
Annals of Ulster, 487, where he (asse. his bones) rests.’'

The following question will be interesting to those who
have studied this matter. ’

Who performed the ceremony of Bridget's religious profes-
sion, and where did it take place Ρ On this question there is a con-
troversy which has excited a good deal of attention. I cannot
pretend to close this dispute amongs1 learned writers by showing,
beyond all doubt, who it was that professed her and where the
religious ceremony was gone through. I shall, however, endea-
vour to prove by sufficiently satisfactory evidence (if not wholly
conclusive) that St. Mel performed the ceremony of her religious
profession, and in his church at Ardagh. Before advancing the
proofs that will, I hope, establish this conclusion, I shall state
the opposite opinions, which may be thus summarised :
