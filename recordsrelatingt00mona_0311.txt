Solemn and touching is at all times the Catholic rite of
dedicating churches to Almighty God, under the invocation of
his saints. Α

Especially solemn, however, and especially touching‚ is
that rite as we have witnessed it here to-day‚ when, almost
within sight of the gray towers of Clonmacnoise, a church has
been dedicated in honour of its founder, St. Kyran, patron of
this ancient diocese. The spirit of the place has added to the
majesty of the religious ceremony a significance peculiarly its
own. As we stand here on this plain of Clonmacnoise, the
Christian life, as it was understood and practised by our fathers
some thirteen centuries ago, comes back upon us in the
beauty of its almost unearthly perfection; and from the very
foundations of this temple spring memories that find for them-
selves a voice in column and arch and altar, until the entire
edifice becomes eloquent of the sacred glories of ancient Ireland.
This is, in very truth, a temple of God3 dowered‚ as the
Church sings, with the Father's glory, espoused in love to the
Royal Christ, radiant with the Spirit’s gifts; but in it, as in
that other temple of which my text speaks, Christ has set up
a pillar, which He Himself would have us admire. It is a
mystic pillar‚ hewn of living rock from out the kindly Irish
earth, sashioned by God's hand, and the culture of Irish
schools‚ into the sainted founder of Clonmacnoise, whose heroic
sanctity‚ as monk, priest, and abbot, made him what Alcuiu
styles him ε the ylory of the Irz'sh mee.

Other churches in honour of St. Kyran have been raised
before now in the favoured spots of Irehznd, where he had
successively resided3 but time and the spoiler's handwasted them,
and the church that we dedicate to-day is to take their vacant
placesq Their record, too, of the saint was but partial and
fragmentary3 for the direct purpose of each was to com-
memorate chiefly that single phase of his life, of which its own
