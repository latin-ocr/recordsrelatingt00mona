“The erecting of a small church‚” said the saint. “Well,

Little Churchf' “Plant the pole with me,' 'said the saint,

“and let my hand be above your hand on it, and your hand and
your sovereign sway shall be over the men of Erin before longff’

“How can that be,’' said Diarmidff ‘since Tuathal is Monarch
of Erin, and 1 am exiled?'' G“od 18 powerful for that,'' said
St. Kieran. They then set up the pole, and Diarmid made an
offering of the place to God and St. Kieran. Soon after the

1118 friendship and increased his gifts to this monastery of his
love 111 the day s of his exile. It advanced slowly 111 y‚ears but
rapidly in buildings, fame, and wealth. Being favouredby God,
kings, princes, and people, more than half of Ireland soon
became subject to its jurisdiction, and paid tribute to it. Such
was Clonmacnoise until the arrival of the foreigner. The
foreign invader having come and firmly fixed his foot in this
land rudely changed the history of this monastic establishment.
Henceforth its history 18, with few interruptione, a record of
burnings and plunderings. Archdall tells us, in his Monasticon
Hibernicom that Clonmacnoise was burned and plundered forty-
nine times A writer of. some authority told us not long ago, that
there came to 118 from England‚ since the Union, 38 many Coer-
cion Acts as there are years in this century. Akin to this fact
is the number of burnings of houses and property, books, vest-
ments, chalices, and other valuable obj ects at Clonmacnoise by
Danes and Anglo-Normans. The last of these burnings, I
regret to have to add, was committed by the garrison of Athlone
in the year 1552. Archdall states that “ the English soldiers of
Athlone did in that year rob and miserably spoil the town and ’
Abbey of Olonmacnoise‚ not sparing even the church, books,
furniture, vestments, 01· other appendages of the sacred altar.
They left it in ruins' :—

“zL' fe and thought they drove away,

81 de by side.
Leaving door and windows wide,
Careless tenants they.”

We may represent to ourselves the expelled monks of those
days expressing their regrets to one another as they left their
2311ng lhggter with sorrowing hearts, in some such words as the

“Come away for Life and Though t,

Here no longer dwell,

But in a city 81011038-

Α great and distant city—have bought

A mansion incorruptible,

Oh, would they could have stayed with us.”
