CLONMACNOISE As A SUFFRAGAN DIOCESE. 129

on the Leinster side, of the province of Tuam, and that Clon-
macnoise, therefore, belonged to the province of the North.
This controversy was carried to Rome. At the Lateran Council,
held in Rome, 1215, Felix O'Ruadhan‚ Archbishop of Tuam,
and Eugene MacGillividen, Archbishop of Armagh, were pre-
sent in person, and formulated their respective claims before
the great Pontiff, Innocent the Third. Sometime afterwards,
a Decree was issued, assigning not only Olonmacnoise, but also
Ardagh, to the ecclesiastical province of the West, to be subject
henceforth to the Metropolitan of Tuam, but, at the same time,
postponing to a future day the decision of the several other
points of controversy.

In the meantime, Armagh was in possession of Ardagh and
Olonmacnoise‚ and for fully a hundred years they continued
thus subject to its metropolitical jurisdiction.

It appears Ardagh remained afterwards continuously and
undisturbedly subject to the archdiocese of Armagh, for the
claim of Tuam was not renewed. But Olonmacnoise, about the
middle of the fourteenth century, was again reckoned amongst
the dioceses of the western province.

His Eminence Oardinal Moran states “that, soon after this
period, we find a list of Irish bishops, preserved in the Barberini
Archives, at Rome3 and in it the See of Olonmacnoise is referred
to the province of Tuam.'' We have already seen that, in the
record of the Consistorial process, in the appointment of Dr.
O’Higgins, it was described as suffragan to the metropolitical
jurisdiction of Tuam. But, during his prelacy, it appears the
controversy was finally closed, and Olonmacnoise was assigned
to the ecclesiastica] province of the North. Thus. we find that,
at the Provincia] Synod held in Tuam in 1523, it is stated, in
the preamble to the Synod, that Dr. O'Higgins, of Olonmac-
noise, was suffragan to the Archbishop of Armagh. The
bishop is thus described :—“ Dominus Kyntius [zze. Quintinus]
O’Higgins Dei gratia episcopus Cluanensis Provinciae Arma-
chanae.'’—“Irish Arch. Soc. Miscellany,'' Vol. I.‚ page 77.
From that day to the present, Glonmacnoise has been con·
tinuously subject to the jurisdiction of the Primatial See.
