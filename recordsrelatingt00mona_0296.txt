relate to the prospective termination of that confidential inter-
course with which the Bishops of Ireland have favoured me„
However, the lapse of time has brought me near the end of
that leave of absence from my duties at Birmingham which
my congregation gave me: and, independently of this, my
strength will not allow me to undergo those frequent journey-·
ings from Dublin to the Oratory, without which 1 cannot, even
partially, fulfil its rule.

I, therefore, propose to place my resignation in the hands of
the bishops in November next. It is now nearly six years
since I was first called on to devote my whole mind to the-
University3 and it is a subject of gratitude to me that I
have been able to serve it so long. It is also a satisfaction to
think that the first difficulties are over, and to recollect, accord-

I cannot withdraw from this great undertaking without
acknowledging the confidence that the Bishops of Ireland have*
shown in placing me at the head of it, and the kindness with
which, according to their opportunitas, so many of them have·
supported me in it.

Ι am, my dear Lord,
Your faithful servant in J esus Christ,
JOHN H. NEWMAN‚
of the Oratory.
The Right Rev, Dr. Kilduff,
Bishop of Ardagh.

and decreed on the 29th of same month, 1867. He was born
at Crosdrum, in the parish of Ballynachree, within three miles-
of Old Castle, Diocese of Meath‚ in the year 1820. Fr. George
Leonard, the devoted P.P., took a lively interest in any boys in
whom he noticed piety, talent and industry— qualities which
made him hope they were called to the priesthood. Young
N ial MacOabe was one of those in whom he took a lively
interest. The good and great Father Hand, founder of All-
Hallows, the largest foreign Missionary College in Europe, was-
another. Both boys were born in the same locality, and ther
edifying pastor of Oastle Dollard used to call them his two most
beloved and distinguished discipleS. Not content with the
3pportunities afforded in his neighbourhood to receive a classi-
cal education‚ Nial MacCabe went to the south of Ireland to
