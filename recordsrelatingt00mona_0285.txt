DR.K1LDUFF. 265

·Ο’ Higgins, Bishop of Ardagh, an election was held for the
·nomination 01 1118 successor in the diocese. Three names were
forwarded to Rome for the approval 01 the Holy See, in the
usual 101111, but amongst them was not that 01 Dr. Kilduff, who
was subsequently named Bishop 01 Ardagh ; and the Bulls 101·
the consecration 01 the humble Vincentian priest arrived in
due course. He entered 011 1118 sacred duties with that holy
zeal and ‘Christian meekness, 101 which he was so eminently
remarkable, and by his precept and example evoked a spirit 01
religious 101110111· throughout the vast diocese over which 110 was
called to rule. He lost no time in Setting about the comple-
tion 01 the magnificent Cathedral at Longford, commenced by
his predecessor, and now the largest in Ireland. The great
work went on most prosperously, and despite the many diffi-
culties, the interior 01 the sacred structure was finished under
the direction 01 Mr. John Burke, Architect. Owing to the
cost and labour 01 bringing stones 01 a large size 11010 distant
localities, the completion 01 the grand portico had to be post-
poned3 but, notwithstanding, the Cathedral 01 1110 Diocese 01
Ardagh is, perhaps, the finest Grecian structure applied 10
religious purposes in the kingdom The good bishop, whose
nentire 1110 was one 01 unwearing activity‚ turned his attention
to the erection 01 0 (11000800 8001100131, 0οἀ 0 8111101)Ιο site in the
neighbourhood 01 the cathedral having been secured‚ the work
soon 001010000οᾶ,11010 plans and designs furnished by Mr.
Burke. Bishop, priests, and peop le, by their united efforts,
succeeded 10 completing the Diocesan College, which, for archi-
tectural effect, harmony, and appropriateness, has no superior
10 Ireland. S'chools and convents 101· the instruction 01 y‚outh
>and sanctuaries 101· piety arose throughout the diocese, and the
old primitive parochial churches were superseded by temples
worthy 01 the people. This was only the external or material
good, or part 01 it, which was effected in the, alas! too short,
episcopato 01 him who was called “ the young bishop. '' But
who will tell 01 011 the moral and. spiritual good which was
--effected under his potent, though gentle 1111ος101 he governed
through the hearts and affections 01 1118 ΡοοΡ10, 10 whose
enduring welfare, 101· time and eternity, his noble and generous
nature was involved. His death was worthy 01 his life, and 110
1108 gone to his everlasting rest, after having accomp lished his
work, like the husbandman who sleep s 'mid the harvest he had
sown in the soil that he had cultivated to bring forth fruit 10
season.
