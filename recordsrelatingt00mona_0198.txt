cated at Maynooth for much less than such an education as
yours would cost ·?—1 do not give that answer as a means of coma
paring the expenses of Maynooth with those of France or Italy.

Pray state whether the doctrines taught in the colleges in
which you were, with regard to the Roman Catholic religion,
differed at all from each other, and whether they differed materially
from the doctrine taught at Maynooth ?—I never found them to
differ on anything essential from each other, nor to differ in
anything essential from the doctrine taught in Maynooth.

In what college in F rance were you ?—I lived in a F rench
College for some time and afterwards in the Irish Oollege.

VVere the doctrines which were taught and maintained in the
colleges in F rance in which you were, with respect to the question,
whether the Pope has any right to interfere, directly or indirectly,
in matters of a civil or temporal nature, precisely the same as
those taught at Maynooth ?—1 have never had an opportunity of
strictly ascertaining what they teach at Maynooth, unless by
conversing with the professors3 but if I am to judge by that
conversation they were precisely the same.

You have not been many weeks at Maynooth Ρ- Not many.

You are aware of the distinction between the cisalpine and
the transalpine doctrine P—Yes.

Is the cisalpine doctrine maintained at Maynooth in like
manner as it is in France P—As far as Ι can ascertain from the
conversations just mentioned it is.

Gould that have been the case at the college in which you
were at Rome ?—I studied in the University at Rome; all
Ι can say with respect to those doctrines is, that I was as much
at liberty to discuss them freely at Rome as Ι could be at May-
nooth, or in France 3. because, as they do not form any part
of our saith, we treat them as mere opinions, and as opinions,
they were persectly open to discussion. I do not mean to say,
however, that any professor taught the Gallican doctrine in
Rome; but those of the University gave an exposition of the
arguments, pro and contra, leaving the students to determine for
themselves.

› Are you speaking now of the doctrine as to the Pope's infal-
libility—speakin g separately from the Council ?—I allude to the
four articles decreed by the French clergy in 1682.

Is it maintained at Rome that the Pope has civil or tem-
poral power out of his own States ?--1 never heard it main-
tained.

Did you ever hear it put as a matter of argument ?—1 did
hear it put as arguable and Ι argued on the question myself, for
the purpose of proving that his Holiness possesses no such power,
nor have I heard such authority ascribed to him by any professor
