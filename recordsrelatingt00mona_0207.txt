tion of some Popes; I leave that to themselves; but I say it>
will never be proved that even those ambitious Popes decreed&
this as a matter to be held by us as an article of saith.

You mean to say that they contrived to mix allusions to·
their spiritual power with the exercise of a temporal power, so-
that ignorant persons might perhaps refer the exercise of that
temporal power to spiritual authority, although they took care-
not to propound the matter as a matter to be believed and held
by Christians as an article, of saith ?—I do not mean to say that
the Popes made use of cautious expressions in order to meet ther
objections of the ignorant alone. Their bulls were open to the
examination of all. But I conceive that their having studiously
avoided to decree or oblige the faithful to believe that they
possessed jure divino the right of deposing princes, proves that
they never dared to propose their opinions as the doctrine of
the Catholic Ohurch, and for what they as individuals may have ,
done they alone are accountable.

In the Bull “Unam Sanctam‚'' issued by Boniface against
Philip the Fair, there is this passage—“ Porro subesse Romano
Pontifici omnem humanam creaturam declaramus definimus et
pronuntiamus omnino esse de necessitate salutis.'’ Is it not
observed upon that passage, in Dr. Delahogue’s “Treatise de
Ecclesia,'' p. 264, that the Pope there takes care to say generally
that every human creature is subject to him, without specifying·
in what manner, so that he might defend himself, if he were
charged with saying that every creature was subject to him in
temporals, by asserting that he meant in spirituals ?—As to that
passage, I think it bears with it an answer in favour of the-
doctrine already stated by me; because Ι assert that no Pope
ever positively decreed that he had de jure divino the right of
deposing kings. Now, if the Pope were weak enough to have
recourse to a dubious phrase, at least that proves that he was
afraid to assert that right openly, and it proveS, consequently,
that it was not his avowed doctrine, or the doctrine of the day.
But the passage referred to can be explained in a favourable
sense to the Pope; he might have said that every human being
is subject to him, which the Oatholics hold, if he talks of spiri-
tual things ; because, as we hold that the Pope is the centre of
Catholicity, and with, whom all Christians ought to hold com-
munion, it is no wonder that he should say, in that sense, that
every human being must be subject to himf's

* subsequently added by the witness z-—In the passage just quoted, the
Pope does, undoubtedly, make use of an ambiguous expression, but whether
for the purpose of excusin g himself, by referring one time to spiritualities, and
another time to temporalities, is both useless and impossible to determine.
Bossuet says that, in using this general language, he providentially abstained
from declaring a falsehood, which he would have done had he decreed ‘that he
