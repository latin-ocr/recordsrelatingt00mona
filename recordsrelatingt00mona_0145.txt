It is stated that Dr. MacEgan held the administration of
Clonmacnoise after his piomotion to Meath, and that, when old
age came upon him, he got Dr. Oheevers, the then Bishop 01
Ardagh to hold the visitations, and perforin his other episcopal
functions 1n Clonmacnoise. The result was, that the Bishop 0
-of Ardag h and Meath petitioned the Holy 800 to have Olonmac-
noise annexed to Ardagh‚ alleging its proximity 011 the one hand,
the poverty of Ardagh on the other, the vast extent of Meath;

and Olonmacnoise having {gen united by the authority of tim
Holy See, uninterruptedly continued so to this day. It is,
however, stated by Father 003011 111 1110 valuable work on the
Diocese 01 Meath, that when Dr. Oheevers was translated to
Meath,after the death of Dr. MacEgan, he applied for the
administration of Olonmacnoise, and received from Rome, as a
reply, a copy of his former letter written froin Ardagh‚ setting
forth the reasons why 0101111100110100 should be united to it.
This put an end to the matter, and Meath has never since
administered the See of Olonmacnoise. Once, and once only,
before Dr. MacEgan's time, did Meath hold its administration,
namely· during the Episcopate of Dr. Thomas Dease. 01011-
11100110100 was also united to the Diocese of Killaloe for a short
period, namely, during the Episcopate of Bishop 0 Richard
Hog an and Florence Kirw an. These two Prelaptes mainly
resided at Clonmacnoise, and ruled Killaloe therefrom.

In 1568, however, it was united, according to the Protestant
division8, to the Diocese of Meath, by Act of Parliament, and
that union continues to this day. The following notes from
