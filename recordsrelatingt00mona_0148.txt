Diaecesis‚ testis ad hoc productus, interrogatus a >me super
qualitatibus D. fratris Quintini—medio juramento dixit, se

eruditum, praedicatorem, bonis moribus et fama aliisque multis
virtutibus praeditum. De existentia vero ecclesiae interrogatus
respondit3 in Hibernia Insula orientem versus, in Provincia
'Tuamensi esse Cluanensem civitatem, sitam inter sylvaS, casarum

Dr. O’Higgins was appointed Bishop of Clonmacnoise before
file close of that year, which was 1516. Clonmacnoise was then
clearly “in the ecclesiastical province of Tuam—was small, con-
sisting of only twelve homes, built of rushes and mud, and
thatched with straw.’' According to the report‚ ‘⁶ the cathedral
was then in ruins—ecclesiam cathedralem esse dirutam. Its
roof had fallen in, and there was but one altar, which was shel-

one poor vestment. Its sacristy, too, was small ; but its belsry
had two bells. The Holy Sacrifice was seldom offered up. and
the whole revenue of the See amounted to only thirty-three
crowns. '

The report added that, as to F ather Quintin himself, “ the
members of the Sacred Congregation should know him well, as
he had been a considerable time in Rome.''

When there were only two Archiepiscopal Sees in Ireland‚

extending to Leath Ouinn and Leath Mogha, all Connaught‚ ¹

and with it Olonmacnoise, was subject to the Metropolitan of
the Northern District. Tuam, however, in the course of years,
gradually grew into a distinct province. But its independence
was not sully signed, sealed, and delivered until after the Synod
of Kells, A.D. 1152; for it is on record that, in the Synod of
Rath-breasaL over which Celsus, Archbishop of Armagh, pre
sided, in 1110, the five sees oi Tuam, Olonfert‚ Cong, Killala,
and Ardagh were clustered together, and still subject to the-
Metropolitan of the North. At the Synod of Kells, the pro-
vince οἷ Oonnaught obtained its full and entire independence,
and the Archbishop of Tuam received the Pallium from the
hands of Cardinal Paparo. After that event, Ardagh was made
suffragan to Armagh, and Glonmacnoise was assigned to the
