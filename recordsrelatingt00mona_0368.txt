an angel of destruction, passed through it and the neighbouring
.Meath. The monastery, however, survived the spoliation. In
1398, Peter, its Abbot‚ was consecrated Bishop of Olonmacnoise‚
whilst in 1447, John O’Mayle, one of his successors in St.
Mary's, was also called to succeed him in the See of St. Oiaran.
Dr. Brady, in his very valuable notes upon the Irish Monaste-
ries, has the following extracts from Roman manuscripts,
