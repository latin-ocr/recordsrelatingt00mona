site had been the scene: this new ehurch will collect and
revive the entire cycle of the memories that otherwise would
perish with their crumbling walls. Two years ago these hands
laid, as its foundation, a stone reverently gathered from the
walls of Clonmacnoise, and bearing engraved upon it the mystic

after its kind3 and its office shall be twofold. It shall address
itself to men and to God. To men it shall proclaim Ireland's
abiding reverence for St. Kyran's virtues ; to Grod it shall
speak Ireland's prayer for his intercession.

Such a monument, and at this time, was demanded by
the piety of Catholic Ireland. That St. Kyran's virtues should
never be without honour in Ireland was announced to himself
‘thirteen centuries ago, in Arran, when first he narrated to his
beloved master, St. Enda, the vision that had been vouchsafed
him of the future glories of Olonmacnoise. He had seen the
noble stream of Shannon flowing among these verdant plains,
and on its banks a stately tree, laden with leaves and fruits,
and covering the land with its grateful shade. “ That fruitful
tree,'' explained St. Enda, “ art thou thyself 3 for thou shalt be
great before God and man, and shalt produce sweetest fruits of
good works, and shalt be honoured throughout all Ireland.''
First fruits of these good works were the monastic virtues exer-
cised by our saint in Arran. He entered that holy island in the
bloom of his youth, and for the long years he sojourned there
he was, as St. Enda described him, “ the flower and strength of
religious observance.'’ His life was a pattern of humility. For
seven years, well-born and scholarly as he was, he toiled with
his hands at those labours which men commit to the least im-
portant os their servants. He would fain continue to the end
in the practice of obedience ; and even when, at length, he was
compelled to become the master of others, he prayed that he
and his charge might still continue under the guidance of St.
Enda. His austerity was marvellous. Lashed by the Atlantic
waves‚ swept by the Atlantic,blasts‚ the island of Arran was the
home of penance and mortification. Hundreds of Ireland's

saints fied to it, as the anchorets had fled to the desert soli-
tudes os the Thebaid. “Arran‚'’ says a recent writer, “is no
better than a wild rock. It is strewed over with the ruins,
which may still be seen, of the old hermitages3 and at their
best, they could have been but such places as sheep would
huddle under in a storm, and shiver in the cold and wet which
would pierce through the ohinks of the walls ..... Yes, there
on that wet soil, with that dripping roof above them, was the
chosen home of these poor men. Through winter frost, through
