CLONMACNorsE, on THE SEVEN CHURCHES. 45

College, Dublin, andis classed H. 2, 16. It treats not only of
the foundation of Olonmacnoise, but also of the succession of
Diarmid, the son of Fearghus Ceirrbheoil, in the sixth century,
in whose reign Tara was deserted and ceased to be occupied by
the Monarchs of Erinn.

The second proof I advance is to be found on the face of that
magnificent stone cross still standing within the precincts of
this venerable Abbey. On this beautiful work of art, and one
admittedly equal to the highest efforts of genius and skill in this
department, are sculptured many subjects of deep interest.
Amongst them are to be found two figures representing two men
holding an erect pole between them. Now, whatever date may
be assigned to the erection of this noble cross (and I admit it
to be a controverted point amongst the learned), there is no
doubt that the figures referred to were intended to commemorate
the manner of the foundation of the “ Eglais Beg‚'' the history
of which then at least was implicitly believed. Indeed, these

Ι will now leave this splendid work of art, with the intention

of returning to its figures and history before I have finished
this book, and go back to St. Ciaran.

We left him with the Monarch Diarmid, holding his hand
above the king's hand, in planting the first pole of the little
church. Thus was commenced and raised by these two great

Satan, and became jealous of Ciaran. Our saint, in token of forgiveness, be⁴
stowed on him “a royal goblet, adorned with three golden gems,’' and the Briton,
overcome by this generosity, did penance, and gave over his church to Ciaran.

One time as Ciaran was seated with the brethren at Inis-Ainghin‚ he told
them to go down to the port, that there they would meet their future abbot.
When they arrived there they found none but a tender youth from the neigh-
bouring territory. They returned and told this to Ciaran, He said to them,
“ Return, nevertheless. and welcome him, for he shall be your abbot after me.’'
He was then brought to Ciaran, and, being tonsured, became a loved disciple of
our saint. The Life adds : “This was Enna Mac Ui Laighsi, a· most holy
illustrious> man before the Lord‚ and it was he that was abbot after Ciaran?

A man from Corco Baiscinn (in the County Clare), came to visit Ciaran.
His name was Donnan, and he and Senan had the same mother. “ What do
you desire, and whither do you go? '' asked Ciaran. “ I seek a place where I

the copy of the gospels and his bell, and left also with him his bell-ringer, i.e.‚
Maelodhrain. Three years and three months Ciaran lived in Inis—Ainghin, and
then he proceeded to Ard-Mantain‚ near the Shannon. Having rested there
awhile, and contemplating the beauty of its sceuery, he said, “ If it is here we
remain we shall have much indeed of the riches of this world, but the souls
sent to heaven from it shall be few.'’ Thence he proceeded forward till he
came to Clonmaenoise, then called Ard-Tiprait, “here will we stay,’' he said,
“for numerous will be the souls that will ascend to heaven from this spot.’'
