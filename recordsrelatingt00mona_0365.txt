-a Roman hotel, with an American Presbyterian Parson‚ after one
of his daily excursions to some of the many obj ects of everlasting
interest to every Christian. He had just been ’ to see the
Mamertine Prison where Saints Peter and Paul were chained ;
he was just after feasting his eyes and mind upon the glorious
Basilicas of San Pietro in Montorio, San Paolo Fuori, La Mura,
>San Pietro in Vincoli‚ and St. Peter's itself—and in giving some
of his impressione regarding what he had seen, he observed
(his eyes moistened with tears) : “ Ι have said to myself more
than once to-day, ‘is it a fact or is it a dream, that Ι am stand-
ing where Saints Peter and Paul stood ?—walking in the very
place where they walked Ρ ’ ” Η6 became overwhelmed by the
thought. It was a moment of inward salutary growth for him.
'“ His mind itself, expanded by the spot, had grown (not colossal)
almost Catholic.’' He was afterwards received into the one
true Ohurch. Yes, there is a salutary spell about the places
-sanctified by the footprints of our Apostles, which elevates.
vennobles, and expands the soul. Be that as it may, the Book
-Qf Armaqlz tells us that St. Patrick‚ having consecrated St. Mel,
and founded his church at Ardagh, passed on to the Northern
Teffia, now the Barony of Granard, and there founded the
Nunnery of Olonbmney, over Which he placed Ameria, sister
of St. Guasact. Guasact himself, son of Milcho, he ordained,
*and afterwards made Bishop of Granard. Ware says that
Granard was an early Episcopal See, founded by St. Patrick‚
vI do not find sufficient evidence to enable me to say that it was
at any time an Episcopal See, independent of Ardagh, There
are two ways by which we may explain the fact that Granard
‹once had a bishop of its own. The first method is founded on
the supposition that it was once an independent 866, with terri-
torial jurisdiction of its own. But this supposition does not
seem probable. If it ever was it had certainly lost its inde-
pendence, and had been amalgamated with Ardagh, before the
Synods of Rathbreasal and Kells, held for the purpose of recon-
structing and consolidating the different dioceses, already too
numerous. In no published list known to me does the See of
·Granard appear amongst the sixty Sees to be so absorbed. Ι
therefore think we must have recourse to the second method of
explanation, which is to be found in the existence of the
*Chorepiscopi

I pass over Dr. Todd's theory of “ non-diocesan jurisdiction,”
because Ι am convinced that the Very Reverend Dr. Gargan,
V.G., has, in his very able essay on the Ancient Ghurch of
-Ireland, entirely demolished its claims to probability.
