and puts this speech in his mouthz—“What has come over
57011, good man, that you should undertake to introduce such a
novelty in our country P We are Scots—i.e. Irishmen—not
Gauls. What levity is this? What need is there of such a
proud and unnecessary work? How will you, who are but a
poor man, find means to finish it ⁴? And who will live to see it
brought to perfection ‘?''

We also find an account, given by the same St. Bernard,
that the same St. Malachy had, some years before, built a chapel
in the same place, made, indeed, of planed timber, but well
jointed and compactly put together, and, for a Scottish (that is,
an Irish) work, elegant enough. And Sir William Petty has
written, in his “Political Anatomy of Ireland,'’ c. 5, p. 25 :—
“ There is at this day no monument or real argument that when
the Irish were first invaded (by the Anglo-Normans) they had
any stone housing at 311, 31157 money, any foreign trade, nor any
learning, but the Legends of the 8311118, Ρ8311018, Missals,
Rituals, &c.; nor geometry, astronomy, anatomy, architecture,
engineering, painting, carving, nor any kind of manufacture,
nor the least use of navigation or the military art.” ·

Dr. Molyneux and Dr. Ledwich follow up the 831110 11110 01
argument, and bring to their aid the Venerable Bede, who stated
that F inian, who had been a monk at the monastery of Iona,
after he was made Bishop 01 Lindisfarne, “built a church fit
for his episcopal see, not of stone, but altogether 01 sawn wood,
covered with reeds, after the Scotic, z'.e., the Irish manner.’'
Fecit ecclesiam episcopali sedi congruam, quam tamen more
Scotorum non de lapide sed de robore secto, totam composuit
atque harundine texit. Besides, they cite 3 passage from the
writings of Tirechen, on the life of 81. Patrick, preserved in the
Book of Armagh, a MS. supposed to be of the seventh century,
in which the following statement is found z—“VVhen Patrick
went up to the place which is called Foirgea of the 80118 01

Awley, to divide it among the sons of Awley, he built there a ·

quadrangular church of moist earth, because wood was not near
at hand.'' “Et ecce Patricius perrexit ad agrum qui dicitur
Foirrgea, filiorum Amolingid et fecit ibi ecclesiam terrenam de
numo quadratam quia non prope erat silva.'' And in the life
of St. Monena, compiled in the twelfth century by Conchubran‚
and quoted by Ussher, it is stated that she founded a monastery,
which was made of smooth timber, according to the fashion of
the Scotic nations, who were not accustomed to erect stone walls
or get them erected. “E lapide enim sacras aedes efficere tam
800118 quam Britonibus morem fuisse insolitum ex Beda quoque,
didicimus, indeque in S. Monnenae monasterio, ecclesiam con-
structam fuisse, notat Conchubranus, tabulis de dolatis, juxta
