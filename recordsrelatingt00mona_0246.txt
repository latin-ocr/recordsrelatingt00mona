Himself requires, when He calls on you, by the prophet J oeI

“to be converted to him in your hearts, in 10811118, 0οᾱ in
weeping, and in 1110010108. -J oel ii. 12. Ῡο8, what God
principally requires is the change 01 the heart and 1110 8100011157
01 118 sorrow, without which your exterior acts would avail but
little. He again says, by the same prophet· . “Rend your hearts ,
and not your garments3 and turn to the Lord your God.’'—
End. v. 13.

To your 10811118 you should also join alms-deeds and prayer;
for “ prayer is good with 10811118 and alms, more than to lay up
treasures 01 gold: 101 01108 delivereth from death, and the same
is that which purgeth away sins, and maketh to find mercy.'’—
J 011, xii. 8, 9. Yes, dearest brethren‚ 1101111118 more powerfully
moves God 10 show mercy to us than 11, 101· Η18 sake, we show
mercy to others, by generously giving them a share 01 1110 tem-
poral goods we have received from His bounty. So dear 10 1110
1110101101 heart 01 our Blessed Saviour is the practice 01 1110
corporal works 01 11101057, 11101 Ηο declares He shall regard as
done to Himself what we shall have done 10 Η18 suffering
members-—the poor.——Matt. xxv. 40. Hence the Church, during
the 110157 8008011 01 110111, 000808 1101 10 100010100οᾱ 11101 111081
1001110110118 practice, repeating in her daily office 111080 words
01 1110 prophet Isaiah: “ Break thy bread to the hungry, and
bring the needy and strangers into thy house: when thou 811011
800 0110 naked, cover him, and despise not thy own flesh.’‘—-
Isaiah, lviii. 7.
