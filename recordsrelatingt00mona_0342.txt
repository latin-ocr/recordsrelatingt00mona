after his consecration he proceeded to his Episcopal See, and

uniform success which everywhere characterized his efforts..
He introduced the Sisters of Mercy into this and the adjoining
state of Connecticut3 and the labours and success of this order*
from that day to this, is a proof of his wisdom in so doing.
His courage was admirably displayed on the occasion of the· ·
disgraceful mob, who, in the year 1855, threatened the sister-
hood and their property in this city. The occasion of this dis-
creditable conduct on the part of the mob, was the conversion
of a Protestant lady of high rank, who entered a convent in the
city with a view to becoming a nun. Her friends demanded
that the bishop should cause her to leave. He firmly answered
non possumus. His lordship was endowed with great physical
strength and moral 00111080, both of which he manifested on
that occasion. His labours were also attested by the increase of

1118 churches and priests, and the various institutions of which
he was the founder.

One incident of Bishop O’Reilly’s life possesses a 11001111οΓ
interest for the priests of Hartford, inasmuch as at the present
day they enj oy the happy consequences of it. Returning from
Rome early in the year 1853, he visited the celebrated 0011080
os Maynooth in search of young clergyme‘n for his diocese. One
of the students noticing a strange prelate in the college groundS,.
who seemed partly uncertain which way to turn to the President’s
apartments, offered his services for the purpose. The bishop
thanked him, asked him to conduct him to the library and other
buildings of public interest, and at last, pleased with the atten-
tions that were paid to him, invited the young student to return
with him as a priest of 1118 diocese. This was a new thought 10
the student, who at that time had fully determined to j0in the·
Order of the Society of J esus, and whose mind ran more upon
China and the distant missions of J apan than upon the quiet
though laborious fields enjoyed by the American priesthood.
Quickly noticin g this inclination‚ the bishop, like a good general,
changed his tactics, and instead of representing the diocese overv
which he presided as one of ease, he narrated the hardships of the
minister of Grod in his journeyings among the mountains of
Connecticut, spoke of the rigors of the winter season, told how
the Catholics were widely scattered in their settlements, and
thus by making his diocese similar to China in its perils and
privations, he succeeded in gaining the youthful student for his
American mission. Grod accomplishes in mysterious ways the-
designs of His eternal wisdom. The young seminarian of
Maynooth became the honoured priest of the Diocese of Hart—
