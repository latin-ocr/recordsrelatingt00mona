‘During his Pastorate at St. J ames’s, he laboured with indefati-
gable zeal for the spiritual welfare of his people, by frequent
missions, and the erection of schools for .the youth of both
sexes, at a cost of AE20,000‚ all of which he paid by his own
exertions in collecting. He was one of the Diocesan “ J udices
Causarum‚'' of N ew York, for many years before his death;
and was admired by all his associate priests and his superiors.
He was, added Monsignor Quinn, “A dear personal friend of
mine, and I shall ever regret his early death‚” which took place
a few years ago.

The Rev. Thomas Farrell, late Pastor of St. J oseph’s Church‚
N ew York, succeeded the Rev. Felix Farrelly. He, too, went
out from the Diocese of Ardagh. He was during life a great
friend to the coloured race in N ew York, and at his death left,
by will, AE500 for the erection of a church for them. It was
since built, and has been attended with much success.

The Rev. Father Boyce, late Pastor of St. Teresa’s Ghurch,
N ew York‚ also went out from Ardagh, and shed lustre on his
native diocese. He purchased a Protestant Ohurch and con-
verted it into a Catholic Parochial Church : the residence of the

3 minister, and made it a presbytery; also buildings for schools,

which he handed over 10 Nuns and Christian Brothers, whom
he established there to educate the youth of his parish. In
the midst of ¹his labours and anxieties he was stricken down by
the great heat of 1875, and died suddenly.

There are many 011101· distinguished priests from Ardagh and
Olonmacnoise labouring with equal zeal in foreign lands, and it
is a matter 01 much regret to the compiler of these records‚
that he has been unable to follow them to their distant homes,
and collect a summary of their good works, and make a suitable
notice of them here. To him it would be a labour of love, and
source 01 unfeigned pleasure.*

Before setting down the list already referred to, the follow—
ing beautiful and touching words of Montalembert, on “ Irish
Missionaries in the Seventh and Eighth Oenturies,'' may be
fittingly reproduced here :—

“A characteristic distinctive of the nation was the impe·
ricus necessity of s reading themselves without, of carrying
knowledge and fait afar, and of penetrating into the most
distant regions to watch or combat paganism. This monastic
