342 mocnsn OF ARDAGH.

St. Patrick visited Granard. For in the Book of Armagh„
lately edited with admirable ability, by the Very Rev. E.
Hogan,S.J., the following passage occurs.

“ Et venit. i.e., S. Patritius per fiumen Ethne, i.e,‚ the river Inny in Teth-
bias—i.e., Teffia, which was divided by the river into ahnost equa} parts,
one of which was in the barony of Granard, et ordinavit melum Episcopum et
fundavit Ecclesiam Bile, i.e., Clonbroney et ordinavit Gosactum filium milcho
Maccubooin quem nutrivit in Servitute vii. annorumet mittens Camulacum
Commiensium in campum Baile-Cuini vel Cumi, i.e., Ballycowan, King’s
County, et digito illi indicavit locum de cacumine Granaret, i.e.‚ Granard,
Ecclesiam Gaithin, ie, Rahin.'’

In the Dictionary of Christian Biography, Vol. Ι., page
395, the Church of Gosact is said to have been at Rahin, near
Tullamore, a distance of about thirty-six miles. It is, there-
fore, certain that the Moat os Granard was in existence previ-
ously to St. Patrick’s advent there, and if Raithim be taken as⁴
identical with the modern Rahan, King’s County, and not some
other place nearer to Granard, the great altitude of the Moat,¹
from which Rahan was thus pointed out by the Saint's finger,
necessarily follows. But I am compelled to think the place so
indicated could not have been the modern Rahan, which certainly
our Saint could not have pointed out, on that occasion, except
in the most vague way, and that barely as to the direction in
which it lay. But there were several small Raths or Raithins in
the neighbourhood. Abbey-larah was one, for Larah signifieS,
a half-Rath. It was probably this place which St. Patrick indi·
cated to St. Guasact, who was afterwards to erect a monastery
there, and preside over it as Abbot. Moreover, he was not
Abbot of Rahin, King's County. What, then, is the exact period
of the erection of this mound, cannot, in my opinion, be deter-
mined with certainty, but may be approximated. If the opinion
of those writers who hold that all the circular forts of this country
were erected by the Danes, be correct, then the age of the Moat
of Granard may be at once fixed. But Ι do not hold that
opinion and, I think, it has now few supporters. I am con-
vinced that the Danes had fortresses os some kind in Drogheda,
waterford, Limerick and Dublin, and the other maritime towns
in which they settled. I am convinced that the impious
monster, King Turgesius—who was slain nobly‚ heroically slain,
upon the Altar of Chastity, for an attempted violation of its
rights, and under circumstances similar to those in which the
Roman Lucretia acquired the surname “ chaste,'' a'nd the Grecian
Hippo, the youthful Cyana, and St. Euphrasia, the virgin and
martyr, piously fell—had erected for himself a large fort in
Loughree, from which he plundered Connaught and Westmeath.
But these are only particular cases in which the Danisb
