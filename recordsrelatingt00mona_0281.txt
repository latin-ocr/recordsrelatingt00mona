DR. KILDUFF. 261

111-00513. Dr. Kilduff's voice, although somewhat harsh, was
powerful and far· -reaching

In addition to the thorough earnestness of his manner and
purity of his life, and self- sacrifice 111 the external works of reli-
gion, there was another element of success—viz. the fulness of
instructive matter. Being well read 111 Theology and Sor ipture‚
he easily found an abundant supply of matter.

In fact, his discour ses were epitomes of Moral and Dogmatic
Theology, expressed 111 the plainest and simplest language, on
whatever subject he treated.p The writer recollects two of his
discourses especially-wia, his sermon 011 the Fourth 001111110οᾱ-
ment of 01οᾱ and his sermon on Scandal, and he never heard as
much Moral Theology compressed into a single discourse on these
subjects. It is to be regretted 110110 of his eloquent sermons can
be found. I could only find a scrap of his sermon on the Resur-
rection and which I omit, as it would give no idea whatever of
the entire discourse, Which I once had the advantage of hearing
him preach, in St. Mary's Church, Athlone, on Easter Sunday
‘preceding his death. He was also a good Latinist and Mathe-
matician. At the annual Concursus, held in Longford, 101
vacant places in Maynooth, and other Colleges, the Bishop was
:the principal examiner, and clearly showed his thorough
iacquaintance with the Greek and Latin Classics. The following
.autobiography, written in his own handwriting and found

.amongst his papers, will give some idea of what he was as a
writer of the Latin language :—
