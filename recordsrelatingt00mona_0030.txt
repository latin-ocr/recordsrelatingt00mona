10 ΒΙοοΕ8Ε OF ARDAGH.

Melchuo brother to St. Mel, bv the same father and mother, was-
the next bishop of this See. He followed his uncle, St. Patrick,
out of Britain into Ireland, before the year 454, and was an
unwearied companion of his labours and zealous imitator of his
virtues, as Golgan tells us ‘.Act Sanct? p. 263, No. 29. The
same distinguished writer adds that St. Patrick placed him ovei
the Ohurche of Ardagh after the death of his brother, St. Mel.
There are but very slender accounts remaining of his successors
in this See until the arrival of the English under King Hemy
11.’Lyn0h,in his MSS· ‘History of gthe Episcopal Succession
in Ardagh,” gives substantially the same account of St. Mel’s
immediate successor. He adds, however, that a holy and close
intimacy existed between St. Bridgid of Kildare and St. Melchuo
just as there did between her and his brother. The words of
Lynch are: “ Et a Diva Brigida sicut frater ejus cultus fuit
utpote quo virginitatis velum ei conferente aridum arae, etc„
as already given on page 5,

Lynch, in his MSS. History, and Ware by Harris, and
ArchdalL and indeed all other writers on the episcopal succes-
sion in this See, observe that the record of St. Mel’s successors
has been, at different intervaIS, broken or lost. Thus the next
successor given by our Annallists is Beochail, whose death is
recorded in the year 741, F. M. After his death an interval or
interruption again occurs in the record of succession in this
diocese as Lynch and other writers already named observe.

St. Erard succeeded to the administration of this diocese
about the year 754. He was postulated by the unanim ous
voice of the clergy and people on account of his varied and
profound learning and remarkable virtues. The words of
Ly nch are, MSS.- . “Ut qui corporis integritatem fastus fluxa-
rumque opum contemptum, morum innocentiam, et sacrarum
litterarum studia, quoad, vixit unice coluit, S. Erardus illi sedi
administrandae clero et populo unanimiter urgente admotus est.''

Reg warding this great and holy bishop, Ware has written as
follow s: “.St& Erard, a native of Ireland Iand Bishop of Ardagh‚

together with his brothers, St. Albert and St. Hidulph. and
nineteen other associateS‚ forsook his country about the middle
of the eighth century and travelled into Germany, where he was
indefatigable 111 the propagation of the Christian saith. He
died at Ratisbon, on the eighth of J anuarv and was buried there
in a convent of nuns. But I find no account in what particular
year this happened. Some centuries after, viz. in the year
1052, he was canonized by Pop e Leo IX. T’his account is taken
out of the Breviary of Ratisbon3 but I do not find an3 mention
made of him in the Annals of Ireland”

L3nch in his MSS. History gives substantiall3 the same
