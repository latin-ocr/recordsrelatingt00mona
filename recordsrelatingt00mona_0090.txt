Bridge, and about an eighth of a mile from the Ohurches‚ and
the latter lies on the brink of the Shannon‚ close to the cemetery,
and opposite St. F inneen's Tower. The Annals of Clonmacnoise
have the following entry, at the year 613 :—“ This year came
on a pilgrimage to Cluainmicnois one Gorman, and remained
there a year, and fasted that space on bread and the water of
R’nyin's Well. He is ancestor to MickConnnamaboght and
Moynter Gorman, and died in Oluain aforesaid.''

Visitors to Clonmacnoise will do well by asking for Mr.
Kieran Molloy‚ who resides in a comfortable farmhouse close to
the cemetery‚ and is familiar with the traditions regarding this
place. His ancestors settled there centuries ago, and were
highly respected in the neighbourhood, as he himself now is.

and saints of Ireland‚ the most interesting spot in the British

Most sincerely yours,
