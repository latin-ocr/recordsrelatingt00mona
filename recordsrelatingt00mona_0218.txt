infallible when speaking ex cathedra in matters of saith before·
any positive or tacit consent of the Church has been given ⁴? Ι
have no doubt that there are many Roman Oatholics who hold
that the Pope when he solemnly pronounces on matters of saith
‘ex cathedra is infallible.

You have stated that in those instances in which Popes have
assumed or endeavoured to exercise a right of deposing kings,
or otherwise interfering with temporal rights, they have not
stated their jus (livinum as the ground of such assumption or
exercise3 have they in those instances to which you refer, or
in any instances you can mention, stated, or does it appear clearly
from the Bull or Decree what the ground was upon which they
claimed the exercise of such a right Ρ In my answers I granted
that some Popes may seem to have claimed a right jure divino of
interfering with temporal concerns ; but I must now repeat what
I then stated, that in no instance did they solemnly decree or
require the faithful to believe that the jus divinum was the ground
of the right which they have assumed.

Is it not an undisputed doctrine of the Roman Catholie
Church that the Pope's power in what is purely spiritual is co-
extensive with that which was committed to St. Peter by our
Saviour? As Catholics believe the Pope to be the legitimate
successor os St. Peter, who was Chief of the Apostles, they also
maintain that in matters of a spiritual nature his power is com-
mensurate with that of St. Peter, and that he enjoys, as the
Prince of the Apostles did, the power of governing the universal
Church. Catholics, however, do not attribute to the Pope that
infaffibility which St. Peter enjoyed as an inspired writer and
immediate Apostle of Christ.

Is it a point of doubt to that extent, and in that particular
case, whether the Pope’s power is commensurate to that which
was entrusted to St. Peter ⁸? In spiritual matters, with the
exception just mentioned, I have no reason to doubt that the-
Pope has equal power in governing the Ohurch.

In what doctrine or decree of the Ohurch is the exception
made with respect to the infallibility of the Pope not being con-
ferred along with all other spiritual jurisdiction ⁴? I am not
aware that it is made in any decree of the Ohurch.

Are we to inter, therefore, that the jurisdiction vested in and
continued with the successors of St. Peter, was not in all points
the same as that which he received? I mean to say that with
the exception I have already stated, that is, the point of doubt
respecting the infallibility of the Pope, he enjoys the same
jurisdiction in spiritual things as God was pleased to confer on
St. Peter, because he has in fact the same necessity for it 3 as he,
like St. Peter, governs the Church.
