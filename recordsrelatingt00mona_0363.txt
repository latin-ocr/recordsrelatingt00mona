RECOLLECTIONS OF GRANARD, co. LONGFORD. 343

invaders, following the custom of the country into which they
came, erected circular mounds for residence and defence. That
Baths, Lisses, or Duns, words used to designate the domestic
and military structures in use amongst the ancient Irish, were
not of Danish origin, may be proved from this fact alone that
they are to be found in every part of Ireland, and more plenti-
fully in districts where the Danes never gained any footing,
than where they had settlementS.

There are abundant proofs that these structures were the
dwellings of the people of this country before the adoption of
houses of the rectangular form. The larger Baths were inhabited
by the better classes, and the great fortified ones by the princes
and chieftains. Judging from the remains still to be seen at
the historic sites, Tara and Rathcroghan, places celebrated for
ages as royal residences, and still affording the finest and most
characteristic specimens of Irish circular forts, Ι should say
that the Moat at Granard was the fortified residence of the
chieftains of that part of Ireland in the pre-Christian times,
In proof of these assertione, Ι may observe that in our ancient
writings‚ the residences of the people of this country were
mentioned by the various names of Rath, Lis, Dun, as
constantly as houses and castles are in the books of the
last three centuries. To illustrate this argument, Ι will give
a few passages which might be extended considerably. In
the feast Dun-na—ngeah (Battle of Moyrath), Oonal Olaen, thus
addressed his foster father, King Domhnall, “ Thou didst place
a woman of thine own tribe to nurse me in the garden of the
Lios in which thou dwellest.'’ On which O’Donovan remarks,
“ The Irish kings and chieftains lived at this period, 637, in
the great earthen Raths or Lisses, the ruins of which are still
so numerous in our land.” In the same tale we read of two
visitors that were conducted into the Dun, and a dinner suffi-
cient for a hundred was given to them, and, in another place,
King Domhnall says to Oongall, “ Go and view the great feast
which is in the Dun.” And in the Book of Leinster, page 85,
it is recorded that Queen Maev, who flourished in the first cen-
tury of this era, sentenced the five sons of Dihorba to raise a
Rath around her which should be the'chief city os Ulster for
ever. Circumvallations were invariably built around the Rath,
Liss, or Dun. The passages already quoted, abundantly prove
· that the residences of the people of this country, before the
introduction of Christianity, were denoted by the words Liss,
Rath, Dun. s And such buildings continued to be erected down
to the twelfth century. Joyce states that Dun was anciently
applied to the great forts with a high central mound, fiat at top,
and surrounded by three or more earthen circumvallations.
