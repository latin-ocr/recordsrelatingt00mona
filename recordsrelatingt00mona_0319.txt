zsystem. Mr. George Henry Lewes (Fortniqlztlgs Reciew, No.
XVI„ 1866, pp. 385, 410,) lately published a sketch 01 M.
Gomte, based on the writer's personal knowledge 01 the man,
and on the statements 01 M. Littre' and 01 Dr. Robinet, the
Philosopher's physician. No man in England has done more
for Positivism than Mr. Lewis; no man is more thoroughly
penetrated with the spirit 01 the new philosophy. In following
him as closely as we can, in the sketch he has drawn 01 the
ιὸ361ῑ61, we are 6316 from being unjust to the memory 01
011116.

Auguste Oomte was born 01 Catholic parents, at Mont-
pellier, 011 the l9th January, 1798. 11711611 111116 years 01 age
116 became a boarder in the Montpellier Lycee, where he soon
became remarkable alike for talent and resistance to discipline. At
the age 01 twelve, having exhausted the course 01 studies usual
at the Lycee‚ he was allowed to begin mathematics. In these
he made such proficiency‚ that in his sixteenth year he had
already gained a first place at the Polytechnique. At the age 01
seventeen he was admitted to the Ecole Polytechnique‚ and
there fully sustained the brilliant reputation 101· capacity he
had acquired in his earlier years. In a short time, however, his
rebellious spirit showed itself by an act 01 insubordination 01 3
grave character. This led to his expulsion, and to his being
placed 101· 3 time under the surveillance 01 the police.

Long before this event, he had cast off both the religious
belief and the royalist tendencies in which his parents would
have trained him. At fourteen' he is supposed to have been a
complete infidel. He was deeply read in the irreligious and
revolutionary literature for which the eighteenth century was
remarkable. It may be easily imagined that his picus parents
were deeply affiicted at the sad change that had been wrought
in their son, and that they became intensely anxious about his
future career. Their anxiety was deepened when he announced
to them his fixed intention 01 proceeding to Paris. They
remonstrated and threatened, but remonstrances and threats
were equally powerless against his obstinacy. He went to
Paris, and by the aid 01 3 few friends, earned 101· himself a
scanty subsistence by giving private 16660116 111 mathematics.
For the space 01 three weeks he acted as Private Secretary to
Casimer Perier; from Perier he passed, in 1818, to St. Simon,
with whom he lived 101· six years. His intimacy with this man
began in enthusiasm on Oomte’s part, and ended in a violent
rupture, which was the result 01 difference in opinion between
the old philosopher and his younger friend.

According to Mr. Lewes, Comte owes to St. Simon’s influence
