·obj eet of hisoonoern, as regards material improvements. The
following facts will show this :—The interior of the oathedral
has been retouched and ornamented under the direction of Gr.
Kelly, Esq., at a eost of over 2⁶:300. Resides, fifteen beautiful
and highly ornamented statues have been placed in the niohes
near the springing of the roos, where looking down in solemn
>and inspiring grandeur upon the congregation beneath, they at
onoe raise the mind heavenwards, and bring it back to other
days of greater and more heroic sacrifice than our present
oivilization may boast of. The statues bear the names of the
following saints 2—At the rear of the High Altar are those of
the Saored Heart of J esuS, Mary, and St. J oseph, St. Mel, and
St. Kieran; over the Sacred Heart Aisle are SS. Patriok,
Bridget, Dominiok, Vincent, and F rancis; over the Virgin’s
Ajsle SS. Michael, Anne, Catherine, Aloysius, and Teresa.

At the great door, as you enter, there are two exquisite oil
paintings on oanvas of SS. Peter and Paul, the work of the
distinguished painter‚ Gagliari.

Moreover, Dr. Woodlock has beautified the Oathedral by the
erection of monumental marble slabs, at once chaste, simple,
and designed to perpetuate the memories of those whose names
are inscribed upon them. It seems to me a most praiseworthy
work, and whilst inviting the prayers of the faithful for the
-illustrious departed, it serves as an enduring and perpetual
monument of the episcopal succession in Ardagh.

Four suoh marble monuments have been already erected,
-and it is to be hoped Dr. Woodloek's suceessors will do like-
-wise, The following inscriptions are to be found upon them :-
