The following description of the' blessing of St. Mel’s.
Gathedral, thirty years ago, written by Dr. Kilduff, and ex-
tracted from his Diary, cannot fail to be interesting :—

Church of the diocese of Ardagh, in the town of Longford, was-
blessed and set apart for divine worship, under the invocation
of St. Mel, the patron of the diocese. ·The officiating prelate,

The Most Rev. Dr. Cullen, Archbishop of Dublin, Primate of
Ireland, and Delegate of the Holy See, gave benediction of the⁴
Most Adorable Sacrament, and the Right Rev. Dr. Moriarty,

* These pastoral addresses have been reproduced here, not on account of
any real or supposed originality of thought, superior arrangement of matter,
or beauty of diction 3 but rather to serve, on the one hand, as an illustration of
the practical devotion, contage, aud sels-sacrifice, with which the Bishop under-
took the gigantic works to which they refer—works impossible of accomplish-
ment (most probably) in the hands of any other man, under tlte same set of
circumstances, and on the other, as a record of the great generosity of the clergy
and people of a poor diocese.
