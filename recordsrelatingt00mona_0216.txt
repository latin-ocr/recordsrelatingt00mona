answering whether any particular Bull relates to things spiritual
or temporal. The only necessary qualification for this purpose
is to understand the Latin language, in which those documents.
are generally written: and by giving the words their natural
meaning it is not difficult to understand whether they treat
temporal 01· spiritual concerns. But if the meaning of any
phrase should seem ambiguous, we should take them rather in a
spiritual than a temporal concern, as we hold that the
Pope, out of his own dominions, has no right to temporal

You have spoken of a work called the “Bullarium Romanum,'’'
have you seen another work, being a collection of the Bulls of
Benedict XIV„ issued in the middle of the last century, in four
folios, edited by himself, and to which he has written a pmface,
and which was printed by the types of the College of the·

Sancti Petri?’' I moy have heard them there, but I cannot
say at present whether I heard them more frequently used in
that city than elsewhere.

In the Tractatus de Ecclesia, p. 149 and following, we find
these words : “ Ecclesia dispersa est infallibilis. Probatur 10 ex
SS„ 2Ο ex Traditione, 30 ex praxi Ecclesiae,’' will you be so

by His own blood, in order that she might be able to preserve-
pure, to the end of time, that saith which He established, and to
