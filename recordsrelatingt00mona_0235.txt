pansive mind, and with -0 desire to make it worthy‚ as far as
human means could make it, 01 118 sacred destination, it has
arrived at a state which, considering its colossal proportions, its
style 01 execution, and the difficult times which have overtaken
its progress‚ should make it a more difficult question 10 say how
it has been so 101 advanced, than, being so 101 advanced, how is
it to be completed? It is in reflecting upon what has been
accomplished that I am full 01 hope as to what remains to be
done. I trust that the diocese at large will generously unite in
realising a sum sufficient 101 proceeding with the work. This
united effort becomes more than ever necessary at the present
time, since the building has now arrived at that stage in which
it is no longer possible to proceed by small additions, as 101 801110
years past, but before anything more can be done, a considerable
sum will be required 10 purchase all the materials 101 roofing
and slating, 810. We should remember that it is not the church
01 0 parish or a district. It is the church 01 1110 diocese. We
are, therefore, to be 01 0110 mind in reference 10 11, bishop,
priests, and people. Would that, putting on the spirit 01
8010111011, we would all say: “the house which I desire 10 build,
is great, 101 001 God is great above all gods. Who then can
be able to build Him 0 worthy house? 11 heaven, and the
heavens 01 110ον0118 00111101 001110111 Him : who am I that I
should be able to build Him a house? The house which I
desire to build, is to be exceeding great and glorious.”—2'
Paralip. ii. 5-9. Considering 101· whom we are erecting an
abode‚ that it is 01 Him we hold all that we possess, and that in
all the splendour and magnificence which this world can 101111811,
we could only testify our desire 10 honour his Supreme Majesty
but 0011 never honour Him with a dwelling worthy 01 Η18 glory,
so 101 110111 withholding our worldly means, we should reach
forth the hand 01 religious bounty, vieing with each other in 0
combined effort to carry forward this diocesan work to a speedy
completion.

I take this opportunity 01 addressing myself likewise to
those benevolent and charitable persons without the diocese
under whose observation these remarks may 1011, invitin g them
to have a share, by their contributions, in the merits 01 80
glorious a work andin the prayers and sacrifice that shall be
offered up 101 011 who will have assisted in building this temple
to the Lord.

In conclusion let me exhort you, brethren‚ to pray without
ceasing‚ to practise- all the duties 01 your holy religion, with
unswerving fidelity, to preserve charity with all men, to be
obedient to the laws and constituted authorities 01 1110 realm.
You will pray with particular fervour 101· 1110 supreme Pastor,
