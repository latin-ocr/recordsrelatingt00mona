Is it not the principle of the Roman Catholic Church that
the power which was communicated by God to His Son, our
Lord, as man, and which power, as He Himself told us, had not
relation to the “kingdoms of this world,'’ the power, and the
only power, which the Pope, as the Vicar of Christ, holds upon
earth P——The Catholic doctrine with respect to the power which
the Pope enjoys upon earth we hold to be this: that Christ, in
,giving their respective missions to the Apostles, instituted St.
Peter as their chief, and that to him He gave the power of
,governing His (jhurch. Catholics hold that the Pope is the
legitimate successor of St. Peter in this same power, and that,
consequently‚ as St. Peter enjoyed the prerogative of governing
the whole Church in spiritualities, so does the present Pope
‹enJ'oy the same prerogative; but by no means do we hold that
any power which was conferred upon the Pope through the
-channel of St. Peter, who was the first Pope, gives him a direct
or indirect power to interfere in temporal concerns.

They hold that the Pope enjoys that species of prerogative
-or jurisdiction in the Church which St. Peter possessed P—-Yes3
with the exception of infallibility, which St. Peter received as one
-of the Apostles, and which it is not certain that the Pope enjoys.

Christ Himself assumed no power in matters of a civil or
temporal nature, and you, therefore, hold that He did not dele-
gate any such power to St. Peter or to the Pope ?—-As our Divine
,Saviour came upon earth to offer Himself a sacrifice to His
Eternal F ather for the redemption of mankind, and not to confer
upon the Church which he was about to establish any temporal
power, and having instituted St. Peter and his lawful successors
the governors of this Chureh, which is exclusively of a spiritual
nature, we maintain that he never vested St. Peter or his suc—
cessors, the Popes, with any other than a spiritual authority,
which alone is sufficient to govern the faithful committed to
‘their guidance.

You are aware, of course, of the proceedings of the Council
-of Constance with regard to John Huss ?—Yes.

And that the conclusion has been drawn from them, or the
imputation attempted through them to be fixed upon Roman
CatholicS, that that Council held that it was lawful to break
saith with heretics ?—I have heard these conclusions drawn
sometimes.

Will you state whether you understand that that Council
maintains any such proposition ?—What I know from history

enjoyed jure (livino any right whatsoever of deposing princes. I beg leave to
observe, that Catholics of the present day are by 110 means accountable for
what may have happened several centuries ago, and if Popes have acted
wrongly, their misconduct is, and also has been, disapproved of by the Church.
