EPISCOPAL SUCCESSION IN CLONMACNOISE 97

Firbisse, under that year, that one Bishop MacOoughlan, and
the Prior of Clontuoskirl and one J arneS, the Archdeacon of
Clonmacnoise, were slain in a battle fought with another sept
os: the MacOoughlans‚ on the Monday before St. John the
Baptist's Day. Now, as Clonmacnoise lies in the MacOoughlan's
country or territory, and as I find no other MacCoughlan a
Bishop at this time of any other Diocese,1 cannot but think
that this cormac MacCoughlan was the warlike bishop slain in
that year. The Annalists speak of him as “a man of great
liberality and a patron of the learned.''

The following notice of this distinguished prelate is taken
from Brady's Episcopal Succession :—Cormac MacOoughlan.
