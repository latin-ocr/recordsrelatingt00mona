DR. AUGUSTINE OHEEVERS

succeeded 111 1751. Η6 was born about the year 1686 at Killyan‚

in the Oounty Galway. His ancestors came from N ormandy
with William the Conqueror into England, and some of them
afterwards accompanied Strongbow when he invaded Ireland.
The N orman name of the family was Ghevre. After some years
this family became settled m various parts of the country. Sir
Christopher Chevers‚ the principal amongst them, resided at
Ballyhaly, County Wexford. He married Anne Plunket, of
Mace- town, and through her became the owner of the Mace-

There the future Bishop of Ardagh was born. Of his early life
little is recorded. It is, however, stated, that he was taken to
France when a mere boy, by his uncle, Lord Mount-Leinster.
He afterwards became a distinguished member of the Augus-
tinian Order, and continued so until he was called upon to govern
the Sees of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise. He was consecrated
Bishop of Ardagh after the death of Dr. MacDermot Roe, and
continued to rule that See until he was promoted to Meath in 1756.
Some years after his translation from Ardagh, Dr. Ohevers fell into
a delicate state of health ; whilst in that condition, he resided at
the house of John O’Reilly, his nephew-in-law, of Anu-ville,
Ballikilchriest‚ near Grannard, Oounty Longford. In 1798,
after the battle of Grannard, the Orange Yeomanry invaded
Ballikilchriest‚ and forcibly entered the house in which the
bishop had resided, and trampled 011 the vestments found there,

which had belonged to him. This they did in hatred of the
Catholic religion.

1756. Anthony Blake, Warden of Galway, succeeded, by
Brief, dated August 11, 1756. Η6 was the son of Blake,
Esq„ of Dunmacreene, in the Oounty of Mayo, a gentleman of
an ancient and respectable English family, who inherited a
handsome remnant of their former possessions, which its seclu-
sion amid loughs and mountains, and its remote situation at the
extremities of the Gounties of Galway and Mayo, had luckily
saved from spoliation. After receiving his education, probably
first at St. Omers, and afterwards at Louvain, he returned to
the mission of his native diocese, Tuam, and received an appoint-
ment in the neighbourhood of Gralway. The tribes, or lay
patrons, of Galway were, at this time, dissatisfied with their
Warden, the Rev. Mark Kirwan, of Dalgan, elected in 1749;
and in consequence, when the triennial term arrived, they
elected the Rev. Anthony Blake in his place, which is said
to be the only instance in which a person once appointed
