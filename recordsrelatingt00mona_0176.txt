156 mocnsn OF ARDAGH

our plan 01 education, or any part 01 it, into Parliament‚ until
the Bill on General Emancipation should be disposed 01, as we
always consider the success 01 this to depend, in a great mea-
sure, on that 01 the other.

We understand that the appointment by us 01 a Medical
and Chymical Lecturer is objected to, from our incompetency
to judge 01 his knowledge in these scienoeS. It was our desi gn to
consult learned professional men on the choice 01 such Lecturers,
after ascertaining their principles and conduct. Neither did
this measure 01 a Ohymical or Medioal Professor originate with
us. It was likewise suggested by our agent at London‚ as
recommended to Grovernment 110111 motives 01 humanity. We
shall most readily give up that point, 11 required, as it made no
part 01 our own original plan. ¹

With the firmest reliance on your brilliant exertions in
promoting the measure we have so much at heart 101· the
advantage 01 society in this kingdom, and with due deference
to your instructions in conducting it on our parts,

We have the honour to remain, &a
