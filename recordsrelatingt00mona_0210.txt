against the law of God ?—I cannot find language sufficiently
strong to express my horror for such conduct. 1 have already
‚stated that all Catholics believe, and at all times believed and
taught, that it is contrary to both the natural and divine
law, to break saith with any man.

There is a passage in one of the decrees of the Council
which some people understand as savouring the notion that it
is lawful to break saith with heretics; the passage is—“Nec
aliqua sibi fides de jure naturale, divino et humano fuerit in
prejudicium Catholicae fidei observanda ;'' are the Commis-
sioners to understand that that passage means only an engage-
ment entered into to the prejudice os the saith, as is a Christian
Protestant of this country emered into an engagement with any
of the F rench Atheists‚ thirty years ago, to join with them in
endeavouring to subvert Christianity‚ that such an engagement,
being to the prejudice of the saith, would have been an unlawsul
engagement, not because it was entered into by a person not of
the saith, but because it was in itself a sin ?—F rom the passage
referred to, it can only be deduced that the Council was of
opinion that no tempora] power which the Emperor or any
-other person might possess could lawfully deprive the bishops
there assembled of the right of pronouncing in matters of saith ;
,and they assert that no contract entered into in prejudice of
Catholic saith is binding on the contracting parties, not because
they or any of them might happen to be heretics, but because
such a contract, having an illicit object, would be null and void
in its inception and from its own nature, as no contract or
promise can or ought to be a bond of iniquit-y.

Supposing a Roman Catholic were to enter into an engage-
ment with an infidel to overturn Christianity, as far as he
could, you would, of course, hold that such an engagement was
void in its inception, not because a contract entered into with
an infidel was void, but because any contract to do an act in
itself immoral and unjust is void in its inception ?—I consider
that any such contract would be null and void for the reasons
already adduced‚ that is, not because it would be entered into
with an infidel, but as being sinful in its very essence3 it would
be more conformable to reason and religion to rescind than to
observe it.

Supposing, therefore, that the Emperor really meant to enter
into a contract with John Huss that the Church should not be
allowed to pronounce upon the question of heresy, inasmuch as
the Church considered that she had a right so to do from God,
the Church would consider that such a contract was in its nature
void P—-Most undoubtedly the Church would not exceed the
vlimits of her rights by pronouncing that such a contract was by
