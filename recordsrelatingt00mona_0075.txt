CLONMAONOESE, ΟΒ, THE SEVEN CHURCHES. 55

“ Life and Thought have gone away
Side by side,
Leaving door and windows wide ;
Careless tenants they !

“ All within is dark as night,
In the windows is no light,
And no murmur at the door,
So frequent on its hinge before.

“ Come away 3 for Life and Thought
Here no longer dwell ;
But in a city glorious—
A great and distant city—have bought
A mansion incorruptible.
Would they could have stayed with us.”—Teomyson.

And now I ask the following question :—

Was the Eglais Beg or Little Church erected at Clonmac-
noise of wood or stone? Before attempting an answer to this
question, it may be well to observe, that a difference of opinion
exists amongst the most learned investigators in the architec-
tural department of Irish ecclesiastical remains regarding
the period at which building in stone and mortar was com-
menced in Erinn. On one side we have Sir J ames Ware and
his very able editor Harris, Sir William Petty, Dr. Thomas
Molyneux‚ Dr. Ledwich, and the learned Dr. Lanigan as-
serting, and supporting by grave arguments, that the Irish did
not begin to build with stone and mortar until the twelfth cen-
tury. On the other side we have Dr. Petrie and Dr. Matthew
Kelly, of Maynooth, and others of acknowledged learning,
maintaining that the churches of Armagh, in the early part of
the ninth century, were certainly of stone, and that most
probably these churches were the buildings erected by St.

Patrick and his immediate successors.
These same learned writers furthermore maintain that the

abbey and cathedra] churches throughout Ireland, from the
introduction of Ohristianity, were generally of stone. In sup-
port of the former opinion, Harris, in his edition of Ware,
writes as follows ;--“ Malachy O'Morgair, Archbishop of
Armagh (who died in 1148), was the first Irishman, or at least
one of the first, who began to build with stone and. mortar, of
which his contemporary, St. Bernard, gives this account :—
‘ Malachy thought it incumbent on him to build a‘wzhapel of
stone at Bangor, like those he had seen in other countries ; and
when he began to lay the foundation of it, some of the natives
were astonished at the novelty, because such buildings were
never seen before in that country.' ''

And a few words after, he introduces an ill-natured fellow,
