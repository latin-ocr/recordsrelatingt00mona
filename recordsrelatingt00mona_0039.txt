THE O’FARRELL MARTYRS. 19

whereof he expired3 yet lingered long enough to receive the
last Sacraments from another of our Fathers before he died;
and this he himself had foretold. Brother Laurence they
dragged, wounded‚ before the Governor, and on discovering
that for the faith, and in obedience to the authority of the
Nuncio, he had joined the Catholic army, he was condemned
to death. He was to have been executed on the following day,
’ and joyfully awaited his fate, but by the intercession of some
friends it was deferred for three days. This was most grievous
to Laurence, who blamed his intercessore and spent the whole
three days in prayers and tears, beseeching Grod not to suffer
him to lose the palm of martyrdom. At length he obtained
his desire, and from the top of the ladder he addressed an
eloquent exhortation to the Catholics 3 then placing the rosary
round his neck, and holding a crucifix in his right hand, and
bidding the people farewell, he blessed them, and meekly
folding his hands under the Scapular submitted himself to the
executioner. When the executioner, after placing the cord
round his throat, pushed him off the ladder3 whilst hanging
he drew both his hands from under his Scapular and raised
the cross on high in both as the emblem of his triumph. The
heretical governor was so much struck that he allowed his body
to be given to the Catholics and solemnly interred by them,
and gave a safe conduct for the clergy to attend, fearing lest
otherwise there might be tumults.’'

whilst discharging the duties of an apostolic missionary, was

of God, he was set' free, and proceeded to Belgium, where he
patiently bore a long illness. He returned to England, and
