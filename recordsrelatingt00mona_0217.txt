disgrace Christianity and common sense. By virtue 01 this
infallibility 01 the dispersed Church, she cannot allow any error
in saith to taint the majority 01 1161· children, and in consequence
01 this same infallibility, some Bulls 01 the Popes may become
articles 01 Catholic saith by receiving the tacit consent and
approbation 01 the Church.

In what manner has the Church in its dispersed state the
opportunity 01 confirming tacitly or by consent? The Pope,
101· example, may issue a Bull concerning some new doctrine,
and declare to the Un iversal Church that this doctrine isheretical;
—and after this decisionis made known to all the bishops, or a
majority 01 the bishops 01 the world, 11 they receive his deci-ee
without reclaiming, within a reasonable time, they are supposed
to have consented, and it becomes 01 faith that the condemned
doctrine is heretical3 the same principle is applicable to the decrees
01 0011110115 01 whose oecumenicity there might be any well-founded
doubts. In a word, any doctrine, either 01 6 particular Gouncil
01· Pope, may become 01 saith in the manner just explained.

That is unless there was a positive reclamation against it on
-the part 01 the bishops Ρ Ῡ65; it must be recollected that it
requires a considerable time, a time morally sufficient 101· the
-bishops to reclaim 11 they thought proper.

Are we right in supposing that 11 the Pope pronounces his
¹judgment upon a matter 01 saith, and that is made known to the
Roman Catholic world, and the bishops, or a majority 01 the
bishops, within a reasonable time, do not reclaim against it, the
¹judgment 01 the Pope in that respect is infallible Ρ Ι11 that 0656
the decision given is infallibly true, not as coming 110111 the Pope,
but as having received the approbation of the Church.

Are we to collect that it is not your view that it is not an
article 01 saith with Roman Catholics that the judgment 01 the
Pope pronouncing upon a matter 01 faith is infallible‚ unless it
'becomes confirmed as you have described by the tacit assent 01
the dispersed Ohurch Ρ No matter in what manner or under
what circumstances the Pope may pronounce on matters 01 saith,
though we treat his decision with much respect, still without the
approbation 01 the Ghurch either represented in a General
001111011 01· 111 its dispersed state, it is no article 01 Catholic saith
to believe that his judgment is infallible.

The oath 01 allegiance states very properly that it is 611
article 01 the Catholic saith that the Pope is infallible‚ but you
,566 there is a 01661· distinction between its being a necessary
article 01 saith that he 15 111161111116, and the matter-of-fact that
Roman Catholics do, very many 01 them, believe him to be
infallible. We wish to ask you whether you have any doubt
‘that a great proportion 01 Roman Catholics do believe him to be
