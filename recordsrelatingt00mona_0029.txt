BOUNDARIES OF ARDAGH DtOCESE. 9

County Roscommon, to Drobhaois, or Droos, on the borders of
Leitrim, Donegal, and Sligo, and from Granard, in Teffia, Co.
Longiord, to the Strand of thuile, in the Barony of Tireragh
and County of Sligo, near Ballysodare. and it may, therefore, be
inferred that Comaicne of Moyrein extended from Killanummery
and Killerry, on the north-western side, to Granard, on the south-
eastern. It is stated, however, under the year 1172, F. M„ that
Dona-l O'Ferrall, of the Annally family, was chief of Conmaicne‚
or that portion of Longford adj oining the Oounty Leitrim. It
does appear certain that the boundaries of Ardagh were fixed
according to the limits of the territories subject to these two
chieftains. At the Synod of Rath Breasail, held about the year
1118, and presided over by Grillebert, Bishop of Limerick, and
then Apostolical Legate in Ireland‚ for the purpose of defining
the limits of the various dioceses, it was declared‚ the Diocese
of Ardagh extends from Ardcarna to Slieve-an-Ierin, and from
Ceis-Ooran to Urchoiltin. This is clearly the north-western
bounclary of Ardagh, for Urchoiltin borders on Dromohair, and
Ceis-Coran is in the neighbourhood of Ballysodare, Co. 81180.

As regards the parishes of Kilronan and Killanumery and
Killerry different accounts, founded on tradition, are given, as
to the manner in which they came under the jurisdiction of the
Bishop of Ardagh. It is, for instance, commonly enough asserted
that the parish of Kilronan, in the Co. Roscommon‚belonged to the
Diocese of Elphin until Monsignor Mac Dermot Roe its Parish
Priest was appointed Bishop of Ardagh. Such, however, was
not the case. It was a part of Ardagh for centuries before, as
the following extract from Lynch's MSS. History of the Ep.
Succession,'' will clearly show: ‘⁶ Ardacha habet paraecias in aliis
comitatibus praeter Longfordiam ut v. gr. in Roscomaniae 00011-
tatu, paraeciam amplam de Kilronan in regione de Tiretuahail,
quam 01110 Muintireadam e Clanaruariiorum stirpe orti inhabi-
tabant. In 811800οε1 quoque Comitatu mediam parochiam de
Killaraidh et mediam parochiam de Killanumuire habet quia
Clanarurii erant olim eorum locorum Domini.''

At the present time the Diocese of Ardagh includes nearly
all Longford, the greater part of Leitrim, and portions of King's
County‚ Westmeath‚ Roscommon‚ Cavan, and 81180. About
the year 1107 the Diocese of F eara-Midhe was divided into two
equal parts between the Bishops of Clonmacnoise and Clonard.
This partition was 'made at the Synod of Uisneach, when the
country from Ologhan-an-imrim, westwards, was given to the
Bishop of Olonmacnoise‚ and from the same Cloghan, eastwards,
to the Bishop of Olonard by Murchad O'Melaghlin and Eochaidh
Ua Ceallaigh‚ 820. See cronicam Scotorum, A.D. 1107.
