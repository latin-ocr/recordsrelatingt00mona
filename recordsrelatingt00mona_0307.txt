DR. MAooABE. 287

’kindly supplied the writer with the following particulars regard-
*ing the last moments and death of Dr. MacCabe :—

In reference to Dr. MacOabe, it is true that I had the sad
'consolation of being with him at the time of his death. We
lived together in the Palazzo Pericoli‚ Corso, during the whole
time of the Oouncil. We left Rome together—I think on the
⁷2lst J uly—-and sailed from Oivita Vecohia for Marseilles. He
died there the second day after our arrival, having previously
*received the last sacraments. In fact, he was dying when he
left Rome, and had been irrecoverably sick for weeks before,
but he could not be prevailed on to leave until the close of the
Council and definition of Papal Infallibility. I was present at
his death, and had his remains conveyed to Paris to the Mother
House of our Congregation. On the morning after their arrival
there, a solemn office and High Mass was celebrated in the
Lazarist Ohurch, and immediately after a most impressive
funeral procession. The remains were conveyed to the Lazarist
Burial Ground in the Mont Parnasse Cemetery, extra muros,
where they repose. Nothing could exceed the honours paid to
his remains by the Parent Community in Paris (95 Rue de
semes). There were three Irish Bishops present with me at
⁴the obsequies—the Bishops of Oloyne, Ross, and Down and
“Connorf’

The Month's Memory was held in due course, at St. Mel’s‚
Longford. N early all the northern prelates‚ and several others,
*together with representatives of the clergy from the neighbour-
ing dioceses, and the Ardagh and Olonmacnoise Priests attended.
His Eminence Cardinal Gullen presided. The late Right Rev.
Dr. Dorrian of Beliast preached the panegyric. His Lordship
·observed-“ I had the happiness os residing in the same house
with your departed Bishop‚ at Rome, since the beginning of last
December until the middle of last J uly, and I could not help
vbeing struck by his very great sanctity. We had in our house
··a small chapel in which the Most Adorable sacrament was kept,
and lze never left that house or returned to it without leaving]
visited our Blessed Lord for a few moments.” Of the many
touching remarks of Dr. Dorrian, none affected the compiler as
much as thaz} one—and there is none lae remembers 80 well—for
it brought vividly before his mind the edcfisinq habits of the
sainted Bishop on the occasions of his visits to Atlzlone. In
the old presbytery there, a room was set apart for the Blessed
'Sacramenm and never, even once, did I observe that Dr. McGabe
¹left the house without having gone into that room for a few
2minutes, or that he returned without having done likewise. His
memor-y is as a sweet odour. Precious in the sight of the
kLord is the death of his saints.
