Dr. Todd affirms that there was “ no archiepiscopal or dio-
cesan jurisdiction in Ireland until the twelfth century, 110 fixed
Sees, no regular succession or jurisdiction3 and that St. Patrick ⁵
and his followers adopted the plan 01 sending forth bishops to- ⁷
act independently, or subject only to the abbot 01 1118 monastery,
or, in the spirit 01 0131181111), 10 1118 01110113111.” 01 course, 11
11118 theory were adopted, Granard would have been as inde-
pendent a See as any other in the country, and St. Guasact
as independent a bishop as 81. Mel 3 that is to say, they would
have had no independence at all. But, as Ihave said, Dr. Todd’s
plan 101 1110 reconstruction 01 031157 Irish history has been com·
pletely destroyed by his Eminence Cardinal Moran and Dr.
Gargan. The theory 01 1110 Order of Chorepiscopi 1011131118.
and is well founded. It is generally admitted that such an
order existed in Ireland 110111 1110 introduction 01 011118113111157
11110 11118 island, and was continued until the twelfth century,
concurrently with “ independent diocesan jurisdiction,'' “fixed
Sees,” and “ regular succession.'' A Ohorepiscopus was apriest
who, having received episcopal consecration, was not appointed
10 any See 01 1110 own3 but continued subordinate to the bishop
01 1110 church or diocese in which he officiated. He was a
bishop3 but, as such, had no territorial jurisdiction. There
were many such bishops here in Ireland, as well as in all parts
01 1110 031157 Christian Ghurch. Such was the practice in the
East and West from the third century. Such was the practice
where St. Patrick himself was consecrated; and bringing the
discipline 01 1118 Μο11101 Church with him into this land, our
Apostle had a bishop consecrated and placed 'in every city,
town, and village. Hence, St. Patrick consecrated, the Book Qj’
Armaqlz tells us, 10111 hundred and fifty bishops. We may
therefore suppose that 81. Guasact was only a Chorepiscopus, and
that Granard was not an independent See, 01· that at the time
01 Guasact's consecration St. Patrick had not yet made a regular
diocesan division. This view receives confirmation 110111 what
is found in the Monastz‘con Hibernieum. There it is stated
that 81. Patrick founded a monastery at Lerha, near to Granard,
and dedicated it to the B. V. Mary, and appointed St. Guasact
its first abbot. I find no record 01 1110 successors 01 81. 01138301
