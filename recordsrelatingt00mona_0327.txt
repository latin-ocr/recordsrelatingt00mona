POSITIVISM. 307·

structures‚ which, in his successive metamorphoses, man forms
and afterwards cast off.' ’'

It is but fair, however, to observe that Mr. Lewes does not
altogether share the religious views 01 M. Comte. First,
because in framing his religious system, Oomte abandoned the
historical method‚ which had guided him in his philosophical
system, and went upon a purely speculative basis. N ext,
because he made his religion into a system. He introduced a
new Grande Etre, a new Bible, a new Oatholic Ohurch, a new
calendar, a new pflesthood, new sacraments‚ a new spiritual
power, a new temporal power. At this point Mr. Lewes, to
whom religion and system are incompatible terms, freed himself
110111 his teachings3 and to this point he came under the 111-
fluence 01 Goethe.

Mr John Stuart Mill, in his Sesstem quoyic, sp eaks' 1n high
„praise 01 M. Oomte' s fundamental law 01 the progress 01 human
knowledge. ⁹¹⁶ This generalised law appears to him to have:

That high degree of scientific evidence, which is derived from the concur-
rence of the indications 01 history, with the probabilities derived from the
constitution of the human mind. Nor could it be easily conceived from the
mere enunciation of such a proposition, what a flood of light it lets in upon
the whole course 01 history 3 When its consequences are tracedy by connecting
with each of the three states of human intellect which it distinguishes, and
with each successive modification of these three states, the correlative con-
-dition of other social phenomena. But whatever decision competent judges

may pronounce 011 the results arrived at by any individua} inquirer, the

·method now characterised is that 111 which the derivative laws of social order
> ,and of social law must be sought.

at length, made its appearance in Ireland. Its formulas have
been heard in Trinity Oollege, and, we deeply regret to say,
zfrom Oatholic lips. It is a painful sign 01 the times to see a
Catholic gentleman join without scruple in the praise which has
been heaped on Positivism by so many who have made shipwreck
01 their Christian saith. But we have said enough 101· the
present 01 the literature 01 Positivism: the system itself de
serves more lengthened notice.

 

Π.

Having glanced at the literature 01 Positivism, it is now
time to proceed to examine the system itself. First 01 all, it
may be asked, Is Positivism a growth altogether new, or is
it rather an offshoot 110111 philosophical systems which have
