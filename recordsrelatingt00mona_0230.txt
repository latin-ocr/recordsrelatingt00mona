210 DiocEsE or* ARDAGH.

Very Rev. Dr. Woodlock‚ President‚ All Hallows College, acted
as master of ceremonies.

Long before eleven o'clock, the hour appointed for the
-commencement of the solemn ceremony, the spacious church
was densely crowded with a vast congregation, comprising a
large section of the Catholic gentry of the city and neighbour-
hood of Dublin as well as of the Diocese of Ardagh and Clon-
macnoise. N early all the Ardagh clergy were present, and
representatives of the Dublin clergy and other dioceses in Ire-
land.

The bishop-elect having entered the sanctuary, robed in
vestments of white and gold, was conducted by the Venerable
Archdeacon Hamilton to the side altar where he knelt inprayer.
His appearance and demeanour were observed with deep interest
and obvious edification by the vast congregation. He seemed
rapt in devout meditation and looked the very impersonation
of a holy priest, who in his day was pleasing to God. The
Right Reverend Bishops Denvir, M‘Gettigan, M‘Nally, Kelly,
WVhelem, and O'Connor occupied seats in the sanctuary.

In a very short time after his consecration he proceeded to
Ardagh and took possession of his pro—cathedral. Longford
being the most central town in his diocese and the most con-
venient for visits from the clergy, as well as the site of the new
-cathedral, he decided at once to take up his residence there.
Happy decision and happy day for Longford. The young
bishop being endowed with great spiritual as well as physical
strength, set to work in a manner that astonished many and
edified all observerS. To the execution of his undertakings he
brought a sound, clear, practical judgment, and a heart strong
almost as a lion's, after his judgment had been decidedly
formed. It was in that spirit and fashion he set about the
completion of the cathedral, a work quite sufficient to daunt

most sanguine expectations. He appealed again and again,
and invariably with surprising success. He set a splendid ex-
ample himself on the occasion of each appeal by a most generous
subscription. It gradually became known that all his own
private income was put into the building fund, and the result
was unequalled generosity on the part of the people of Longford
especially and the laity throughout the diocese in general.
The happy day for its opening at length came. His heart was
glad and rejoiced, as did the hearts of his priests and people.

gisfflpwn beautiful description of that joyous event will be seen
