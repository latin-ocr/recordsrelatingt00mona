north-western wall has inscribed upon it the following words :—
“ Carolus Goghlan Vicarius Generalis Clonmacnoise, propriis
impendiis, hanc dirutam ecclesiam restoravit, A.D. 1647.''

Here it may be interesting to give the following particulars
regarding the family of Gharles Coghlan, or MacCoghlan, who
was a distinguished member of it. for he was of the MacOoghlan
sept, lords of Dealbhna Eathre or Delvin Ahra, in ancient Meath.
The extent of their country was very considerable. It com-
prised the greater portion of the present barony of Garrycastle.
The name Dealbhna is derived, according to O'Donovan‚ from
tribes of the Dalcassian race, who took the name from Cas, an-

cestor of the O'Brien tribe of North Munster. The MacOoghlans
were chiefs of great influence and importance in former times.

· The Annals of the F our Masters, A.D. 1548, place the castles of

Ceann Coradh (Kincor) and Feadhan (F adden) and the monas-
tery of Gallen in their territory, and state that the English
plundered that part of it extending from Bealach an fhothair
to the Togher of Oeannmona. It appears, therefore, their ter-‘
ritory comprised at least the tract from the townland of Bal-
laghanoher‚ in the parish of Banagher, to the above-named
Togher, in the parish of Lemonaghan. Connal McGeoghegan
places Lumcloon Oastle in the parish of Gallen, in this territory,
and septs of the MacOoghlans at Leackagh, in the parish of
Lemanaghan, Olondowna, now Clonony and Boynean. In the

the parish of Ferbane, in the same territory. The same writer,
in his Life of St. Canoc, patron of the parish of Clogham places
the monastery of Gallen in the MacCoghlan territory. Tradi-
