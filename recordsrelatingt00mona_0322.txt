Once more he had to toil for his daily bread as teacher of
mathematics. This change of circumstances developed the pre-
posterous self-conceit of the man. We shall let Mr. Lewes tell.
how :—

“ With the publication of the Philosophia Positive he assumed
his place among the great thinkers of all ages, but drew upon
himself the bitter hatred of rivals and humiliated professors,
which, being supported by the indignation of theologians,
metaphysicians, and journalists, who were irritated at his.
dangerous doctrines and sweeping scorn, ended in driving him
from his official position. He was turned adrift once more to
seek a laborious existence as teacher of mathematics. The story
is told by him in his preface to the sixth volume of the Philoso-
pln'e Positive, and in fuller detail by M. Littre. It need not be-
repeated here ; the sad result is enough. To mitigate the blow,
three Englishmen, Mr. Gmte, Mr. Raikes Onrrie, and Sir W.
Molesworth‚ through the intervention of Mr. John Mill, offered
to replace the official salary for one year, understanding that at·
the end of the year Comte would be either reinstated, or would
have resolved on some other career. The year passed, but his
re—election was again refused. At first this troubled him but-
little. He had learned to regard the “ subsidy ’' of his admirers.
as his right. It was due from the rich to the philosopher ; and
the philosopher could the more effectually use his powers if all
material anxieties were taken from him. This, however, was by
no means the light in which his case was seen in England. Mr.
Grote sent the additional six hundred francs, but a renewal of'
the subsidy was declined. He was dreadfully exasperated. Ι
remember hearing him speak of the refusal as if some unworthy
treachery was practised upon him. I tried to explain as deli-
cately as I could what I conceived to be the point of view of his
friends who declined to be his bankers ; but he had so entirely*
wrought himself into the persuasion that the refusal was a moral
dereliction, and that no excuse could be offered for men who had
wealth with holding a slight portion of it from thinkers, whose
lives were of importance to the world, that I saw it was useless.
He had a fixed idea on the subject, and it may be seen expressed
in haughty terms in his letter to Mr. Mill. lf there is much to
be said (and 1 think there is) in favour of his idea of the duty
of the rich towards thinkers whose aims they approve, there is
also not a little to be said on the other side, and not a little blame
attributable to his manner of urging his claims. He chose to
assume a “ haute magyz'strature morale’' which others would not
recognise. He professed to speak solely as a philosopher, but η
showed too much personal preoccupation. It is sad to hear that
the result of this was a coolness on the part of Mr. Mill, and the--
