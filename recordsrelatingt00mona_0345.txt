mour BEV. DR.» MONAHAN. 325

Bishop :Monahan visited Ireland twice, chiefly for the purpose
of seeing his aged parents.. He remained at their residence, for
the most part, whilst he was in Ireland. The Right Rev. Dr.
O’Higgins having given him a cordial invitation to go to Bally-
mahon and meet General Lamoriciere, who afterwards became
so famous as a soldier and strategist in commanding the Irish
Volunteers that went to Italy to defend the Pope's temporal
dominions from the usurper3 he most gratefully accepted it.
Dr. Monahan and Lamoriciere had been intimately acquainted
previously. All three were cordial friends, and the two bishops
being half Frenchmen, by education and residence abroad, they
felt quite at home in each other's society. The general, like his
countrymen, arose at a very early hour in the morning—four
o'clock3 and unlike most of his countrymen, was a very pious
and practical Catholic. He passed the hours of the morning in
the library until the bishop’s Mass, which he invariably attended.

An amusing incident occurred in connexion with this visit.
The presence of a foreign general in Ballymahon, and under the
roof of so distinguished a prelate as Dr. O'Higgins, who had a
well-earned reputation at the time for advanced patriotism,
excited the fears of the British authorities. The result waS,

the Sacrament of Confirmation for Dr. O’Higgins, who at that
time was just beginning to decline in health.

O'Connell afterwards referred to this matter in one of his
speeches. He said—“ See how much the Government are
frightened at the state of things in Longford. They are about
sending Wellington, with a large army, down to Ballymahon,
that the hero of Waterloo may fight fifty thousand Irish rebels,
whom Dr. O'Higgins has concealed in his back parlour, where
a Continental General is drilling them.'' Dr. Monahan shortly
after returned to the Port of Spain, and was often heard refer-
ring with much humour to the fact, that he was once looked
upon as a dangerous character and conspirator against legiti-
mate authority in Ireland. He was considered a very handsome
Prelate, being over six feet in height, of graceful figure, sallow
complexion, and bright grey eyes. His whole demeanour and

simpTe, digniyiied, and unostentatious manners. The priests of
Ardagh, with whom he was acquainted, used to speak of him
with enthusiasm. He returned to the Port of Spain, having
gone through the Oonfirmations for Dr. O’Higgins, never to
feast his eyes upon his native land. Having reached Trinidad,
