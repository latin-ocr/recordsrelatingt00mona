Diocese, and of Ireland. It will be dedicated in honour of St. Mel, first
Bishop of this ancient See, and nephew of St. Patrick‚ by whom, at the very
commencement of his Apostleship‚ he was consecrated in the same parish where
the Cathedral now stands. For the last three hundred years, a Catholic
Chureh of this splendour would not have been tolerated in Ireland, nor, indeed,
had the Catholics, up to the present, adequate means, nor were they in suf-
ficient numbers in Ardagh, to accomplish so glorious an undertaking. When
finished it will be the chasest, most extensive, and most elegant church of
modern times, in any part of the United Kingdon1.’' See Appendix for
first Pastoral Letter on this subject, addressed by Dr. O’Higgins, in 1841, to the
elergy and laity of Ardagh,

It was certainly a wonderful idea, having regard to the
circumstances of time, place, and the poverty of Ardagh. Two
things must be presupposed in a bishop conceiving such a
gigantic project in the face of most adverse circumstances: viz„
great faith in God and the charity of· the faithful, and a mind
culltlivated and matured among Gontinental Cathedrals and
¹Co e es.

Dgr. Higgins was not less esteemed by his flock than by his
brother bishops. Whenever the Irish Church was to be repre-
sented at any foreign court Dr. O'Higgins was selected for that
honourable office, for which his familiarity with various
European languages‚ the courtesy and dignity of his manners,
and his acquaintance with many of the principal men of Europe
eminently qualified him. Amongst his papers have been found
autograph letters from Emperors and Popes. He was deputed
to visit the Irish College at Paris 3 he was unanimously chosen
to go and treat with the Oourt of Belgium about the Irish
educational foundations lost during the revolution, a great
portion of which he recovered, and twice he went to Rome,
sent by a majority of the Prelacy, on the question of education.
As a patriot, Dr. O'Higgins ranked first amongst the Hierarchy.
He was greatly attached to O’OonnelL and O'Oonnell was not
less attached to him. He was in fact the Dr. Oroke of that
period. He was a Catholic first, and afterwards a true Irishman,
before, above, and begyondeverytlziny else.

In 1843, when Ireland held a position before the nations to
which posterity will look back as perhaps the brightest and
grandest page in her chequered history, after the name of
O'Oonnell stood the name of the Bishop of Ardagh, on the
roll of honour. His memorable speech at the Repeal Meeting
in Mullingar created a sensation which pervaded every class in
the United Kingdom. His wrathful denunciation of land-
lord corruption and tyranny made the oppressors of the poor
tremble. The enemies of justice and freedom assailed him
from every side, but he went 011 undaunted by them.

After the meeting in Mulh'ngar he was fiercely and bitterly

assailed, in and out of Parliament, as a dangerous demalfggue.
