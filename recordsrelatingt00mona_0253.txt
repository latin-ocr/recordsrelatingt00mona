delightfu] spectacle of a “ multitude of believers having but one
heart and one soul,'' towards an object of religion in which, as
members of the same diocese, you have a common interest and

concern.
I must take this occasion also, dearest brethren, of remind-

ing you that your wants and necessities, your welfare and pros-
perity, as well spiritual as temporal, are in constant remem-
brance in thecathedral, and that since it was opened the Holy
Sacrifice of the Mass has been offered, and shall continue to be
offered, on the F east of our glorious Diocesan Patron, St. Mel,
for the living and deceased benefactors. Thus, by contributing
to the house of God here on earth, we are preparing tabernacles

for ourselves in the kingdom of heaven.
WVhen Solomon had completed the Temple of Jerusalem, the

Lord, as we read in the Holy Scripture, appeared to him at
night, and said to him: “ I have heard thy prayer, and I have
chosen this place to mysels for a house of sacrifice .......
My eyes also shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer
of him that shall pray in this place. For I have chosen, and
have sanctified this place, that my name may be there for ever,
and my eyes and my heart may remain there perpetually.'’
Paralip. vii. 12, &c These are the consoling assurances that
await us when we also will have finished the house of the Lord,
*choosing it for Himself as a house of sacrifice, of the one ador-
able sacrifice of the new dispensation, His eyes shall be open
and His ears attentive to the prayer of him that shall pray in
this place. Thus whils't the Holy Sacrifice shall continue to be
offered in your cathedral, that is, as long as it shall exist, yom-
welfare of soul and body, shall continue to be presented in
union with it before the throne of God, and the divine blessings
shall be poured down from on high to be diffused throughout
the length and. breadth of this extensive diocese.

It only remains, then, that I fix the day for the collection,
which wffl be simultaneous in all the parishes of the diocese.
In the name of G0d‚ then, let it be Sunday, the 26tlz day of
February nemzi, which will be the first Sunday of Lent.

The grace of our Lord J esus Christ, and the charity of God, and
the communication of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.
