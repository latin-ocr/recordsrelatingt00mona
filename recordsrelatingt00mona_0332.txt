can make no honest claim to whatever credit belongs to the
inductive philosophy. Bacon’s “ mission,'' says Dr. ‘Newman‚*
was the increase 01 physical enjoyment and social comfort ε and
most wonderfully, most awfully, has he fulfilled his conception
and his design. Almost day by day have we fresh and fresh
shoots and buds and blossoms‚ which are to ripen into fruit on
that magical trec 01 knowledge which he planted, and to which
110110 01 118, perhaps except the very poor, but owes, 11 not his
present 1110, at least his daily food, his health, and general well·
being. He was the divinely provided minister 01 temporal bless-
ings to all 01 118, 80 great, whatever I am forced to think 01111111 as
a man, I have not the heart, 110111 111010 gratitude, to speak 01 him
severely. And, in spite 01 the tendencies 01 1118 philosophy, which
are, as we see at this day, to depreciate or to trample 011 theology,
he has himself, in his writings, gone out 011118 way, as 11 with a
prophetie misgiving 01 those tendencies, to insist on it as the
instrument 01 that beneficent F ather who† when He came on
earth in visible 101111, took on Himself, first and most promi-
nently, the office 01 assuaging the bodily woimds 01 human
nature. Now, Positivism completely discards this providential
1111881011 01 knowledge, and altogether refuses to admit into its
circle the idea 01 God. Resides, the inductive philosophy admits
a priori axioms, and speaks 01 a Philosophia Prima- ; Positivism
rejects them z the former includes our inner consciousness
among the subjects to which its principles may be applied:
the latter limits its observation to outward facts. Bacon, after
observation, seeks to discover the natm-es 01 things. Comte
holds all investigation into the essences 01 things to be useless
and impossible. Systems which are kept apart by differences
80 deep-rooted and 80 large can have little affinity one with the
other.

Again, the law 01 intellectual progress laid down by M.
Comte, as consisting 01 the triple stage, theological, metaphy-
sical, and positive, fflls an important place in his system.
According to him, every branch 01 science must invariably pass
{hrough these stages in succession. What is to be said 01 this
aw t>

We shall find, upon analysis‚ that this law, as expressed by
M. Comte‚ includes two statements : first, that every science
which can occupy the intellect, has invariably passed, or must
necessarily pass, through the theological, metaphysical, and
