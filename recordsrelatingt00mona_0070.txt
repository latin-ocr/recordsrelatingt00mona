chapel at Iona, on that memorable Sunday morning, the 9th
June, 597, when Oolumba’s virginal soul went back to his

Creaifrllother reference, during their earthly life, to Oiaran and

Columba, and I have finished.
One day, in the course of conversation between these young

Saints, the new church which the holy Abbot Mobhi had just

erected was made mention of.

Oiaran said he wished “it were full of holy men who, by
night and day, would sing the praises of God.'' St. Columba
said “ he would wish it were filled with silver and gold, to afford ,
relies to Ohrist's poor and build churches and-monasteries.''

The venerable Abbot heard of what they said, and prophe--
sied that those holy youths would receive favours from heaven
in accordance with their pious wishes. The prophecy was lite-
rally fulfilled in Ciaran's case, not during his earthly life, it is
true, but not long after his life in heaven began. Young and
old, peasant and prince, the votary of learning and the aspirant
to evangelical perfection, noble and king, crowded to Clonmac-
noise in search of peace, wisdom, and virginity.

A celebrated pagan poet represents the human race in anxious
ursuit 01⁰: a place called Olympus, where, in rich poetic fancy,
e dreamed there was an ever tranquil abode of the gods, never

shaken by winds, nor wet by showers, nor covered by snow,
where the hardened frost does not annoy, and the sky is ever
pure and cloudless, and a bright glory overspreads.

“ Apparet divum numen, sedesque quietae
Quas neque concutiunt venti, nec nubila nimbeis
Aspergunt, neque nix acri concreta pruina
Cana cadens violat ; semper sine nubibus aether
Integer et large diffuso lumine ridet.''

Darerca, daughter of Ercan, son of BuachalL son of Glas, the poet of the
Giarraighe, of Irluachair, was his mother. He was of the race of Core, son of
Fergus, son of Ross, son of Rudraighe, thirty-three years was his age when he
yielded his spirit to heaven. Cuimin, of Condeire, states in the poem which
begins ‘ Patrick of the Fort of Macha loves‚’ &c., that Ciaran never looked upon
a woman from the time of his birth, and never told a lie. Thus he says :—

“ The holy Ciaran, οξ Cluaint loves
ἓέῗὲῗὲἶὶῗῖἓῗὲὲῗζξῐὲθτὲἑῖ ἓῗεὲἶὸξὲῖ swen'e‘
Nor looked upon woman from his birthss’
“It was Ciaran that eomposed the celebrated poetical lay which begins,
‘ An rim a ri, an richid rain,’ asking of God a prolongation of life that he might
perform more labour and service to Him. Great are his signs and his miracles
as is evident in his life. A very ancient vellum book states that Ciaran of
Cluain, was, in his habits and life, like unto John the Apostle.”—Ma1⁴tyrology
of Donegal, page 241. The Irish Life in the Book of Lismore ends with the
following beautiful eulogy of our saint 1—“There is no one who could fully
enumerate the virtues and miracles performed by St. Ciaran, for there was no
one of greater charity and mercy, of greater labour, abstinence, and prayer, of
greater humility and assiduity, of greater gentleness and mildness. of greater
