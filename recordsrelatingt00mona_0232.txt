we should so live as to be able to say to the faithful, with whose·
guidance we are charged, ‘⁶ I have given you an example that
as I have done, you do likewise.'' This was the great lesson.
the Apostle of the Gentiles had constantly before his mind, and.
hence he was enabled to say to the early Christians, ‘⁴ be ye
followers of me, as I also am of Christ.''-—l Cor. iv. 16. In
thus exhibiting in our lives an example of that conduct which.
the faithful are to imitate, we shall, according to the exhortation.
of the Holy Council of Trent, so regulate our lives and habits„
that in dress, deportment‚ conversation, and all our exterior
conduct, nothing shall appear but what is serious, what is sub--
dued and full of religion. We shall avoid even lighter faults,
which in us, on account of the sanctity of our character, should
bear the stamp of special enormity,* in order that the whole
tenor of our lives may, according to the words of our Blessed
Saviour, make us “the light of the world.''——Matthew, v. 14- ’
Oh! happy the sheep that are conducted by such Pastors, who·
themselves are made the “ pattern of the flock.''—l Peter, v. 3.
F ollowing such guides they will be conducted without fail “ to*
the most fruitful pastures—there shall they rest on the green

To FEED 'HRDL—This obligation we are to discharge chiefly
by affording to the faithful the food of God's Word and the·
Sacraments. This is the support whereon the sheep of Christ
are to live in their passage through the desert of this world to the
pastures of eterna] life. And, “ as ministers of Christ and dis-
pensers of the mysteries of God.'’—l Cor. iv. l—we shall
always bear in mind what treasures we possess in the Sacra-
ments for the benefit of the faithful. They have here a remedy
for all their spiritual necessities. Here they find so many
fountains of grace springing up to everlasting life. Whilst,
therefore, the faithful shall always find easy access through our·
ministry to these Heavenly Institutions, we shall feel it our duty
to encourage their frequent approach to the Holy Sacraments of
Penance and the Blessed Eucharist. In these divine mysteries
our ever blessed Saviour has provided medicine and food, both
to cure the diseases of our souls and to impart to them the<
support we require on our pilgrimage through the desert of this-
world. We shall not, therefore, be content with affording the
faithful the opportunities of partaking of these sacraments once
or twice a y ear, as it were by routine; but, explaining the riches
of divine grace contained therein, we shall exhort them to have
frequent recourse to them; that they may live in the constant
friendship of (1οἆ and make dailyii progress in virtue.
