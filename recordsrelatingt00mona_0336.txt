nection with All-Hallows (he is still, indeed. one of our Directors),
:greatly and deservedly esteemed and beloved by all, professors
and students alike, by reason of the amiability of his character,
the sanctity of his life, and thorough devotion to every, even
‘athe most minute duty. His appointment to the Catholic Uni-
versity was a great loss to this Institution.'’

Such is the testimony of Dr. F ortune. Before his appoint-
ment to the Rectorship of the University he was promoted
to the Diocesan Chapter. Soon after, he was elevated
to the dignity, rights, rank and privileges of a Domestic
Prelate of His Holiness, at the Roman Court. Monsignore
Woodlock was made Vicar-General of Dublin, in the year 1877.
In the discharge of the delicate and important duties of that
very responsible office he had the advantage of the advice,
experience, and learning of the late Cardinal MacCabe, who was
then Vicar-General of Dublin, as well as Auxiliary Bishop,
'The See of Ardagh became vacant in 1878, by the death of Dr.
Conroy, and Monsignore Woodlock was elected at Rome in the
following year to succeed him. He was consecrated in the
Sistine Chapel by His Holiness, Pope Leo the XIII., on the lst
-June, 1879, and in a few weeks afterwards solemnly took pos-
session of his Cathedral at Longford, in the presence of the
Diocesan Chapter, nearly all the clergy of Ardagh and Clon-
macnoise, and a vast congregation of the laity. The Cathedral
looked in its best form, on account of the previous costly and
'careful preparatione. As regards his career from that day to
this I will be brief, for it has been advised by the highest
‚authority ne laudes hominem in vita sua. I wiss, therefore, confine
myself to facts, only observing furthermore, that Dr. F ortune's
testimony, regarding Dr. Woodlock's career in All-Hallows,
might truly be written of his administration in' Ardagh and
=Clonmacnoise. Prominent amongst the special works of Dr.
WVoodloclss as Bishop, must be reckoned the new Convent at
Ballymahon,* the foundation of the same order of the Sisters of
Mercy at Mohil, Co. Leitrim, together with a new Oonvent and
beautiful new Church recently erected in that thriving town by
the present zealous and energetic pastor, the Rev, Francis
Donohoe3 the extension and enlargement of the La Sainte Union

‘ This Convent was founded during the episcopacy of the late Dr. Conroy,
who received a cheque for 131,000 sterling, together with a large farm of valu-
-able land, and the palace of the late Dr. O’Higgins, for the use of the Nuus, from
Thomas Maxwell, Esq„ of Ballymahon, a noble, generous, and religious
man. He was known and highly esteemed by the last four Bishops of Ardagh,
and by Dr. VVoodlock, as is well known to the writer. This Convent is a
FOUXDAUON from the Mercy Convent, Moate, founded by the late Rev. Dr.
Kilduff. A few weeks ago the Sisters of this flourishing community celebrated
with much religious eolat the Silver Jubilee of their foundation.
