BOUNDARIES OF ARDAGH DIOCESE. 17

tinuance of family feuds between the O’Farrell claris. There

was neither sacristy, nor belfry, nor bell. The vestments and

altar ornaments are described as hardly sufficient for Mass,

which was rarely offered up, there being only one priest in the

entire district. Under such circumstances, it does not seem

{Improbable that Dr. William O’Farrell resigned the See before
is death.

Roderick O'Malone, a Canon of the Cathedral at Clonmac-
noise, succeeded. He is described as “ honestis parentibus natus
aetatis annorum fere XL„ sanus mente et corpore, ac bonae con-
versationis et famae, in jure canonico bene instructus et litteratus,
ac in sacerdotii ordine constitutus et ad ipsius Ecclesiae regimen
et gubernationem aptus et idoneus.’' Theiner‚ p. 521. It
appears that King Henry VIII. addressed a letter to Pope Leo
X. recommending the appointment of Dr. O’Malone to the See
of Ardagh3 the letter is dated Greenwich, ‘26th July‚ 1517,
and the following is an accurate copy:

“ Sanctissimo Olementissimoque Domino nostro Papae.
Beatissime Pater, post humillimam commendationem et devotis-
sima pedum beatorum oscula. Expositum nobis fuit Cathedralem
Ecclesiam Ardakadensem perexigui census ac proventus in
dominio nostro Hiberniae per obitum Reverendissimi in Christo
patris, Domino Wilhelmi ejus novissimi Episcopi, impraesentia
vacare suoque pastore esse destitutam, et cogitantibus tum nobis
ei providere propositus fuit venerabilis vir Magister Rogerius
O’Moleyn, Cathedralis Ecclesiae Cluanensis canonicus, vir
modestus, circumspectione, probitate et doctrina non mediocriter
probatus, quem et nos idoneum existimavimus cui dictae Ecclesiae
Ardakadensis cura committatur eique praeficiatur. Quo circa
Vestrae Sanctitati eum commendamus ut eundem Magistrum
Rogerium praedictae Ecclesiae praeficere ac Episcopum et Pasto-
rem constituere dignetur, quod et honori atque utilitati ejusdem
Ecclesiae futurum putamus et nobis erit admodum gratum: et
felicissime valeat Vestra Beatitudo. Quam Deus Altissimus
longaevam conservat‚'' etc. This is a begging sort of letter,
and, although the petitioner was the king, they took‘ a long time
at Rome to grant the object of his request; for more than a year
elapsed before Dr. O’Malone was appointed Bishop, and the
Pope's sanction was not given until the sworn evidence of three
independent Irish witnesses regarding the fitness of Roderick
O’Malone was placed· before His Holiness. Moreover, Dr.
O'Malone resided in Rome before his appointment to the See
of Ardagh‚ and his merits were therefore known to the Car-
dinal charged with the Consistorial inquiry. It can scarcely
be inferred that the king’s recommendation expedited his

appointment. It seems rather to have delayed it. A} length,
