wont to come thither on the feast of St. Francis, then nigh at
hand. This was an old usage in that place, as there were no
inns in the neighbourhood. In the meantime, while the soldiers
were making merry on the good cheer, never intended for them,
I contrived to effect the escape of the guardian and some others ;
and, indeed, Ι, too, might have got off, had Ι so willed it, but
as it was within two days of the time appointed for making my
religious profession, I preferred remaining in custody, knowing
right well that Shane would send me to the castle on Lough—
shodie, where the provincial was confined. On the expiration
of the second day, Shane ordered me and a lay brother out
of: the convent, and setting us on horses, sent us prisoners to
Ballimore. Alas, Ι never will forget the horrors of that day,
for we had gone hardly a mile when Shane came galloping up,
and commanding us to halt, directed our attention to a mass of
fire and smoke clearly visible in the distance, exclaiming at the
same time with fiendish malevolence :—‘ Vile poltroons! see
how Ι have burnt your monastery to the ground? Thus, on
the 3rd of October, 1601, did that inhuman monster give our
venerable house of Multifernan to the flames.

“With a heavy heart we held on our way to the castle of

will not be forgotten when Blount, our puissant deputy, has

crushed O’Neill and O’Donnell. The broad lands of those base
traitors shall soon be given to her Majesty's true lieges3 and,

assuredly, fingers like yours were better employed with sword ’

or matchlock than fumbling a rosary.'

“ Little did I heed the ribaldry of the profane soldier3 and
weary as was the road to the Castle of Ballimore, it seemed light
and pleasant when Ι reflected that it led to the crowm'ng of my
most cherished aspirations. At length we reached our J ourney's
end, and Ι had the happiness of finding myself face to face with
the Bishop of Kilmore, the guardian of Multifernan, Father
Bernard Moriarty, and some other members of our community.
They all were astonished at seeing me, for they knew that I
could have escaped from the convent had Ι wished to do so ;
but when Ι explained to them the motives which induced me to
remain a prisoner in Shane's hands, nothing could exceed the
joy which each of them evinced. ‘ You know, dear father,' said
I to the provincial, ‘ that the term for my novitiate expires to-
day, and that Ι desire nothing so much on this earth as to be
