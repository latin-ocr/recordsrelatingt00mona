1088 and his burial in Clonmacnoise. He was, unquestionably,
the most distinguished of the Clonmacnoise savans, whether we
regard the variety or extent of his learning, that appeared up
to his time. In his Annals he quotes Eusebius, Oros-ius, Afri-
canus, Bede, J osephus, St. J erome, and several other writers of
great eminence. He collated the Hebrew text with the Sep-
tuagint version of the Scriptures, and throughout showed him-
self to be a masterful critic. He is said to have been the first
compiler that computed from the Incarnation of our Lord. He
was familiar with the modes of correcting the Calendar, and
made mention of the Lunar chle, and used the Dominical
letter with the Kalends of several years. He was the first to
fix a starting-point for credible and authentic Irish chronology.
Its date he reckoned was that of the founding 01 1116 Palace 01
Ε11161116, 111 the North, an event which took place about three
hundred years before the birth 01 Christ. His famous state-
ment—via, “ Omnia monumenta Scotorum usque Cimboeth in-
certa erant'’—is now universally accepted as correct, and the
-starting-point 01 credible and authentic Irish history is de-
:servedly admitted to begin with the glories 01 1116 Ultonian
Dynasty 01 Emania. Tigernach’s invaluable book, called his
Amzals, may be seen in Trinity Oollege, the Royal Irish Aca-
·demy, the British Museum, or the Bodleian Library. ·

“Chronicum Scotorum’'—i.e., The Annals 01 1116ἰ800110 Race.
There has been 801116 controversy regarding the authorship 01
11118 great work, but recent discoveries have terminated disputes
*amongst learned men on this point. The erudite Professor
Hennessy, M.R.1.A.‚ has clearly shown, in his introduction to
the “ Chronicum,'’ collated, translated, and edited by himself,
that it was written 61 0101111160110186, 801116 111116 111 the twelfth
century, by Gilla-Ohrist O’Malone, Abbot of Clonmacnoise.
This most valuable collection of our history contains an account
of Irish affairs from Adam to the Age 01 Christ 1150. A copy
of this work may be seen in the collection of the Royal Irish
Academy‚ classed 23, O', 8. There 18 110 higher or more accu-

Τ116 next imperishable work compiled at Olonmacnoise 18
the book entitled the “Annals of Clonmacnoise.’' It does not
appear certain that the original copy now exists, but there are
some well-authenticated translations There is notably one in
English, made from the Irish, in the year 1627, by Connla
MacEgan, for his friend and kinsman, Torlogh MacCoohlan,
Lord 01 Delvin, whom he addressed in the following words :—
