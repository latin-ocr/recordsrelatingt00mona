visit ⁴in the previous year to the island of St Dominica‚ andvthe
-cruel dissensions that prevailed there, and the N ovena gone
through for the purpose of applying a remedy to those grave
-disorders, the Archbishop added: “ the Grovernor of the Island
said to me in the beginning of the little Mission, ‘if in the
space of ten years you succeed in bringing about a little calm,
I will believe you worked a miracle.' '² His Grace concludes
with these words: ‘⁴ In the farewell visit I paid to the Gover-
nor of the Island, although a Protestant, he said to me: ‘ I did
not think there were miracles since the time of our Saviour3
but how could Ι deny them, having before my eyes so great a
miracle of grace! N 0 human power 00qu have been able to
produce a result.’

“In 1843 Ι visited the Island of St. Lucia. Being power-
fully seconded by my zealous fellow-labourers‚ Ι gave a Mission
in the different parishes of this colony. I administered there
the Sacrament of Confirmation, and we gathered everywhere
‘abundant fruits‚ which amply rewarded us for our labours and
toils.

“ The following fact deserves to have here a particular
place. The labourers of each parish came to their Parish
Priests to ask of them the favour of being allowed to defray
the expenses of the reception preparing for the Bishop. They
immediately set their hands to work ; they dig with unshaken
-vcourage into the ruins of the ancient fort, and after unheard-of
labours, they extract from them with songs the cannons which
were buried there since the old wars of England and France.
Transported with joy, they convey to their parishes‚ by the
..force of their arms and with songs‚ those pieces of artillery,
·c]imbing the mountains and braving a thousand dangers.

‘⁶ N umerous fiags soon float over the church‚ on the peaks,
son the mountains, and adorn the houses. Triumphal arches
„are erected on the way by which the Bishop is to pass. Each
0110 wished to contribute to form them ; one by bringing palm-
branches‚ another his garland‚ some by bringing the handsomest
flowers, others the choicest fruits of the country, to be suspended Ι
to them. A numerous cavalcade, composed of the most re-
spectable inhabitants, comes to meet us. The bells of the hamlets
are in motion as on the most solemn feasts‚ and announce afar
the approach of the pro'cession. The cannen of the mountain gives
the signal 3 the Bishop, accompanied by the clergy and caval-
·cade, has arrived at the bounds of the parish. At the first sight of
the Pastor, all, as one man, fall 011 their knees and receive his
benediction. In an instant after, a grand and long procession is
“ formed, as if by enchantment; it precedes us and advances with
the most perfect order, singing hymns. It arrives at the church ;
