not from printed books P All the clerical lectures that I at-
tended in the French University were not delivered from such
documents; they were delivered by the professors, probably
,after having consulted different authors on the subject.

Were they delivered extempore ‚2 They were delivered with-
out the assistance of any written memorandum.

Were the students expected to prepare themselves through
the medium of any particular printed books for the subject
matter of those lectures P As the students who came there
*were from different colleges each student prepared himself,
probably, by the class book used in his house; however, he was
at liberty to consult other authorised authors.

WVas the mode of delivering public lectures the same in the
University of Rome as you have just described to be adopted
in Paris P In my time at the University of Rome our clerical
professor dictated from a written document3 but Ι understand
the present Pope has abolished that method, and requires the
professor to confine himself to an exposition of some authorised
class book 3 the professor studies his matter, and whatever point
he considers difficult he verbally explains to the students.

Wffl you describe the nature cf any lectures that may have
related more particularly to the Scriptures in the Irish College
in Paris P Was there a professor of Sacred Scripture P There
was one of the gentlemen of the house, the Vice-President‚ who
explained the Scriptures ; Ι did not attend his class, and Ι
cannot say what his mode of explanation was, but Ι presume
that he consulted the authorised commentators, and gave out
the. substance of what he read.

Was there a professor of Sacred Scripture in the University
of Rome P Yes.

Can you describe the general nature of the course of his
lectures P He explains and marks out for the students a certain
portion of Scripture, and in a succeeding class he both interro-
gates the students and explains the difficult passages.

What part of the Scripture does he principally select for the
subject of the exposition P He explains the whole Bible, perhaps
not beginning with Genesis, but Ι believe he omits no part.

Are all the divinity students of Rome required to attend

his class P Ι do not know if there is any particular obligation,
but Ι know that most of them attend* '

* Living as we do in the light that comes from the decrees of the Vatican
Council, the spirit and tone of this very able “ evidence '⁵ will doubtless appear
obj ectionable to many ; but I would ask such persons to reflect upon the period
and circumstances in which it was given 3 that the Professorial Staff at Maynooth
in those days largely consisted of Freneh Reffigees, and that Dr. O’Higgins
himself had passed most of his previous days in French Schools and Universities.
