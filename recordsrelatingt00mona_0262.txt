is none that considereth in the heart.''—xii. 11. How many a
sinner would be stopped in the very commission of crime, did
he but reflect for a moment on the presence of God—did he but
remember that the Omnipotent Being whom he was offending,
and who by a single act of His will could hurl him into the
abyss of hell, was standing by him, a spectator of his guilt.
So, too, of the thought of salvation. If Christians had a proper
idea of it, and kept this idea before their minds when assailed
by the world, the devil, or the flesh, they would never sin. For
this 1176 have the assurance of the Holy Ghost himself, recorded
in the inspired volume : “ Memorare noviss-ima teta, et in (eternum
ozon« peccabis—Remember thy last end, and thou shalt never sin.''
—Eccl. vii. 40. Yes, our last end—or, what is the same, our
eternal salvation—is, 111 the designs of God, to be the grand
leading thought of our existence. It is the most important
consideration by far which should occupy our minds during our
mortal pilgrimage—for, “ what doth it profit a man if he gain
the whole world, and suffer the loss of his own soul.”—Matt.
xvi. 26. And yet, how few think of God, or of referring their
actions 10 Him? How few really think of the “ one thing
necessary‚” the salvation of their immortal souls? How few
keep before their minds the thought that was ever present to
St. Teresa? “There is but one God, one death, and one soul
for each,” she would exclaim ; “ there is but 0116 God3 and if
we forfeit His friendship, to whom else shall we have recourse ‚9
one death; and if we die badly, how can we repair the loss Ρ
0116 60111, which once lost, is lost for ever.’' Such was the re-
flection which weaned that great saint from all of earth that
was earthly3 and the same it is that forms the greatest torment
of the damned. ⁴⁶ Nos insensati ! '’ they exclaim in thrillin g
accents of despair, “ Nos insensati—fools that we were ! ’' We
knew that there was but one God, and we have lost Him ; we
knew that we could die but once, and we have died attached
to sin, and at enmity with that God who Would have saved us ;
we knew, indeed, that we had but one soul, which once lost,
must suffer for ever3 and yet, through our own fault, we have
lost it. “ N os insensati—oh 1 fools that we were ! ’'

Dearly beloved brethren, you have yet time to convince
yourselves, by the sad experience of others, that the great, the
only affair of a Christian is his eternal salvation. You have
yet time to secure your election by the Great J udge in the Valley
of Josaphat. Will you neglect this grace given you by your
merciful Father‘? Will you be so blind to your own dearest
interests as to entail on yourselves everlasting woe‚ by devoting
all your energies to the service of this perishable world, and
neglecting the “ one thing necessary ’'—your eternal salvation Ῥ
