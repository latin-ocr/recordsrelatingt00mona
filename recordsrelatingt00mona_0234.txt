your account that Ι entertain myself thus seriously with your⁴
venerated clergy Ρ Sharing in their responsibilities so largely,
Ι cannot be free of their solicitude for your salvation. It is,
however, consoling that if our duties are most serious in your
regard, you are ever willing to correspond with the efforts of our
zeal. Bound together by a community of suffering for ages;
the zealous clergy of this land and our faithful people are in-
separably united in the charity of Christ. With St. Paul we
may ask, “Who shall separate us? Shall tribulation? or dis-
tress ⁴? or famine Ρ or nakedness Ρ 01· danger Ρ or the sword Ρ ”
—Romans‚ viii. 35. All these trials we have already withstood.
They are the glorious proofs of our holy faith‚ “ much more
precious than gold which is tried by the fire,'' and to be found
“unto praise and glory and honour at the appearing of J esus
Christ.''——l Peter, i. 7.

Reflecting, therefore, dearly beloved brethren, upon our
obligations in your regard “ I bow my knees to the Father of
our Lord J esus Christ ''-—Ephes. iii. 14—and lift up my
heart to thank the great Author and F inisher of our faith, for
that incorruptible fidelity with which, at all times, and more
especially under the trials of these latter years, you have clung
to your devoted pastors‚ following their guidance, receiving at
their hands the food of immortality, and sheltering yourselves
under their protection.

I purpose, with the divine assistance, to have the happiness
of going amongst yOU, in your respective parishes, to administer
the Sacrament of Confirmation to your little ones. You will, Ι
3111 sure, eagerly avail yourselves for their instruction of the
arrangements the clergy will everywhere make for the purpose.
If there be any grown persons amongst you whO, through any
cause have not received this holy sacrament they will zealously
prepare themselves for the opportunity they will have now af-
forded them. You will bear in mind that whoever omits to
receive Confirmation (through contempt) is guilty of a grievous>
sin, so that the contemptuous neglect of it alone would entail
everlasting perdition. Especially amidst the dangers and.
attacks which menace and assail us just now, the faithful should
have recourse to this sacrament, which strengthens and enables
the Christian to profess his faith openly, and to perform all the
duties which religion prescribes without sear, shame, or human
respect.

I cannot close this address without a word to you upon a
subject which equally engages your feelings as also those of
