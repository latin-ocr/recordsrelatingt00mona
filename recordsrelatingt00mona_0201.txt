MINUTES or EvIDENCE. 181

Do you also subscribe to the principle, that it is no article of
‘the Oatholic faith that the Pope is infallible ?—I do; because it
is the truth that it is no article of the Catholic saith*

The question, whether or not the Pope has the gift of infal-
libility‚ is a mooted question in the Roman Catholic Ohurch P—
Yes; it is a question left perfectly free for professors and
:students to discuss as they may think proper.

A man may either adopt the opinion that the Pope is infallible,
-or may reject the opinion that the Pope is infallible, continuing
in the communion of the Catholic Ohurch P—-Perfectly so.

Do you understand that those who adopt the opinion that
the Pope is infallible, mean that he is infallible in propound-
ing articles of saith to be believed and held by the Catholie
Church ?—-With respect to that question, there is a discrepancy
of opinion. Some maintain that he is infallible only when he
propounds a doctrine to be believed by the general Ohurch;
others think that even in Bulls, for regulating the discipline of
particular countries, he is infallible; but I believe the number
of those who hold that opinion is much fewer than those on
mhe other side.

Do any such persons dcem that he must be considered infal-
lible in issuing Bulls for the regulating of churches which
might intersere with the civil rights of sovereigns ?—If there
be question of mere discipline, and that the Bull issued hap-
pened to come in collision with the temporal rights of a sove-
reign, I have no doubt that the Pope would revoke it, of his
vown accord ; and I am convinced that his Holiness would never
issue such a document, unless through ignorance of the fact.

Supposing that the Pope were not to revoke it, would the
Bull be considered as binding in that particular country to
which it was issued P—If the Bull clash with the temporal

position.

Supposing that the Pope was neither to insist upon it, nor
to revoke it, but simply to leave it, having issued it, would it
be considered as binding P—That hypothesis can hardly be
admitted, because if it infringed on the rights of a sovereign,
he would naturally apply to the Pope to have it revoked.

Put the case of s'uch a Bull having been issued, as a matter
-of fact, and that the sovereign does not reclaim against it, nor
the Pope revoke it, would it, in that case, have a binding obli-
gation or not ?—1f the Pope issued a Bull which infringed upon
the rights of the sovereign, and that he thought proper to yield
