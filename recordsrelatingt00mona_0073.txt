CLONMACNQISE, on THE SEVEN CHURCHES. 53

lowed spot where this sad event took place, and looking around
at all that remains of his shrine and those of the great saints
and scholars who succeeded him, one is reminded of the words

of a very distinguished poet—

“ Even the faintest relies of a shrine
Of such a worship wake some thoughts divine-'³

The memorials seattered over this plain, where the “ Arts'' of
Ireland once found their eentre, where the schools of Ireland
collected promising youths, kept them for a time, and then, like
the Trojan horse, sent them out, full of varied erudition, con-
summate piety, practical sympathy, with Kieran' 8 motto (“ Do
to others as you should like others to do unto you”), and there-
fore ready for the proper discharge of every serious and import-
ant duty, are fading away. Twot> beautiful specimens of ancient
stone crosses, numerous antique gravestones, two ma] estio round
towers, the ruins of more than eight churches, presenting inte-
resting varieties of Christian architecture, together with a few
old trees of apparently equal antiquity—-the lone survivors of
the vast woods of Clonmacnoise—casting their shadows over the
lonely graves of the dead, remain to testify, even in their dila-
pidated condition, the refinement oi? our fathers at the close of
the ninth century. There also remains the ancient causeway on
the right, leading along the river to the nunnery, 01100 repaired
by Devorgilla ; and on the left are the ruins of an old castle,

“ The relies of Paul and of Peter,
The seamless garment of our Lord,
With the smooth hair of Mary,
They are in its Urdam (i. e.‚ Sanctuary).

‘⁶ Interred within the Urdam
Are the founders of the Rath,
W ith one hundred and four
Who neglected not the hour of prayer.

“ With Domnan and Tocha,
And Silan, the learned lep er,
With Moedog, of fair countenance,
With Fergus, with Enna.

‘⁸ With Odhram and Caeman,
And Fursa, heavenly, veneiable, austere
With Lugna and Gother,
With Sother and Bernard.

‘⁵ Close to the Urdam on the north,
In a very slender house (teob),

Axe twelve men whose prayers
Would make even hell a heaven.

“ Close to the Urdam on the south,
There are four—it is right to mention them
They would light up earth as heaven
Did they come to visit it.

“ Nine thousand with nine score
And nine are the saints, as I recall,
Not feeble their daily invocation,
Who rest beyond under the Taraill
