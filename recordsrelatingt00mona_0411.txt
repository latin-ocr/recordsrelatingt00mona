and to sing sacred music in a manner ahnost divine—like
choirs of angels. Gharlemagne sent royal gifts to Rector Colgan
of Clonmacnoise, because he had trained so distinguished a
scholar for him. Look around you, I say, and behold if you
can the grass-clad foundations of so famous a University3 you
cannot. They are gone, with the woods that once crowned
these hills now so bare. Look around once more, and what do
you behold Ρ At your feet the kings of three provinces, and
amongst them one of the monarchs of Ireland, Tordelvac
O’Oonnor, laid to rest here in 1155, and with him Roderick
O'Oonnor in 1198, beside the high altar in the cathedral. The
chieftains, petty princes, and warriors, who during 1110 were
engaged in almost uninterrupted conflicts, are here also, lying
peaceably together in their silent graves close to the archbishops,
bishops, abbots, saints, and scholars who lived, flourished, and
died here. Each and all of them, by their united efforts, made
Glonmacnoise what it was, ancl what it must ever be regarded, ·
viz.‚ one of the chief centres of sanctity and learning in ancient
Ireland. And now standing over their ashes we behold erect,
and casting their shadows over this city of the dead, just as
they did centuries ago, when they themselves beheld them with

Braving shock of earth and air.''

And we behold also over their graves, standing as of yore,
the old Celtic Oross of the ScriptureS, now aged almost 900
years. I said Olonmacnoise was the result of their united efforts.
It was so, indeed. The first pole of the first church was erected
here by the joined hands of King Diarmid and St. Kieran. These
circumstances can scarcely fail to be interesting to those who
have not read them. At the time St. Kieran came down from
the Island of All Saints in Loughree and landed here with his
disciples, to lay the foundation of his little church, Diarmid, a
powerful prince and pretender to the throne of Meath and
monarchy of Ireland, happened to be living in exile in these
parts. He and his few faithful followers passed their days and
nights on this river. Their wants were supplied by the hospi-
tality of the people then living at both sides of it. St. Kieran
and his disciples were observed by the exiled prince coming
down from Athlone, and seeing them planting a pole on this
Hill of Wells, Diarmid at once landed with his men 3 and ap·-
