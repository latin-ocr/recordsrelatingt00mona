THE “O’FERRALL'’ SEPT, PRINOES OF ANNALY.

This illustrious family is of Milesian origin ; descended from
Milesius, who was King of Galicia, Andalusia, Murcia, Castile,
and Portugal, and who is known as Milesius of Spain. The
Milesians came into this country several centuries before the
birth of Christ. The three sons of Milesius who left any issue
were Heber, Tr, and Heremon. From Ir descended FergusMor‚
who (by Meave, or Mab, Queen of Connaught) was the father of
three sons, named respectively Gonmac, Cim, and Coro: from
Oiar are descended the O’Gonnors of Kerry, who were kings‚
Assrz' Iserriensz's (the O’Connors of Connaught being descended
from Heremon); from Coro, the O’Oonnors of Oorcomroe‚ and

Oounties of Leitrim, Slig0‚ and Galway, and that part of the
County of Westmeath anciently called Onz'retzeaele‚ but more

part of Conmacne now known as the County of Longford‚ and
Cetiroqzeaelz, in Westmeath, was called “ Upper Annaly;'' and
the adjacent part of the Oounty of Leitrim was called “ Lower
Annaly3 '² and his posterity, after they lost the title of Kings
of Conmacne, which his ancestors enjoyed‚ were, upon their
submission to the Orown of England‚ styled Princes or Lords of
both Annalies until a recent period.

Third in descent from Angall was Feargal (a quo ‘⁶ O'Ferrall'')‚
who was King of Oonmacne, and was slain fighting on the side
of Briau Boru‚ at the Battle of Clontarf‚ A.D. 1014.
