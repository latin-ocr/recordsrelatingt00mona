*although elevated by his personal exertions to a station that
might have dazzled any character, although so speedily raised
to the noblest title that can be conferred on a British subject
(unless he be an heir presumptive or a consort), in a colony
where the supreme authorities are of the Established Church of
England, and in which are many other Dissenting OhurcheS,
the tenor of his conduct commanded the esteem and respect of
⁴shose authorities. Unassuming in manner, yet he always main-
tained the dignity of his office. Aware of the futility of religious
controversy, he studiously abstained from engaging in it, and
yet, during his administration, the saith which he professed, made
rapid progress over all parts of his diocese. And in this colony,
the Oathedral completed, the St. George's College, the Convent
of St. {Joseph, and the Presbytery are monuments that: will
ever stand to the credit of the memory of the late Archbishop.
But what is more noble, notwithstanding his success and eleva-
tion, his Grace the Most Rev. Archbishop Smith was, in
manners and character, the same humble Priest that landed here
in 1827.

Such were the qualities that distinguished the departed
jprelate. That they are overrated is not probable. For, if
public demonstrationis indicative of public feeling and senti-
ments—v-whether affectionate or adverse—if acts are evidence of
the inward impulse, the 12th of May, 1852, leaves no doubt as
[to the degree of: estimation in which the late dignitary was
held. From the highest to the lowest, from the richest to the
poorest, from all ranks and orders, all came forth on that day
to testify, by their presence, their appreciation of the merits of
the deceased. When we consider the immense concourse of
“ἓὲἓῖἳῃῖθΞῗᾶξῖἶὲἓῃῗὲἷῗὲθξὲἒῖ(ῗοῖἕέἶΞῖΠῖὴξῖίὲῗῗῖἶῖἕιῖῗέἒῗζρῗ
rent on the face of everyone3 it cannot be doubted that the
Most Rev. Richard Patrick Smith carried to the tomb the
'esteem, love, and veneration of all.

His Grace was most zealous and indefatigable in his efforts
for the salvation of souls. The means he adopted to obtain that
end were truly apostolic. In his visitations of the islands under
his jurisdicti0n‚ he usually took with him three or four priests
skilled in giving missions, and he held in the parishes visited
by him, a Novana. During those nine days, the devotions and
practices usual in this country on the occasion of a retreat for
the people, were gone through with the happiest and sometimes
almost miraculous results. The following extract from a letter
of Dr. Smyth’s‚ addressed in 1846 to the Members of the Central
Council of 'the Propagation of the Faith at Paris, will illustrate
..these assertions. After giving a most interesting sketch of his
