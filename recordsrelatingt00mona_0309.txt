⁷ DR. CONROY. 289

'There he discharged his functions with brilliancy and skill. In
⁴che following year his constitut-ion, never very robust‚ began to
-decay‚ owing to the heavy and incessant labours inseparable
from his delicate and trying mission, together with the severity
‘ot' the climate. His final illness came upon him in N ewfound-
land, in the house of his highly-valued friend, the Right Rev.
Dr. Power‚ Bishop of that See. All that medical science could
do for him was done by most eminent physicians, but in vain.
He died a most holy death, surrounded by Dr. Power‚ his con-
fessor, and two Sisters of Mercy, on the 4th of August, 1878.
His last words were “ My God, accept the sacrifice of my life.’'
His remains were conveyed to Ireland to be buried in his own
Diocese of Ardagh.

Before they were taken to Longford‚ they were placed in the
Cathedral, Marlborough-street‚ Dubfin, where a solemn office
-and High Mass were celebrated for the repose of his soul, in
presence of Cardinal Cullen‚ who presided, other prelates and
several clergy. Afterwards they were removed to his own
cathedra] at Longford, whither came several bishops‚ the
priests of Ardagh, and many from the adjoining Sees, to take
part in the funeral obsequies.

The remains of this highly distinguished prelate were
interred in the little Oemetery of the Sisters of Mercy, Long-
ford. A beautiful Irish cross has been placed over his grave.
R. Ι. P. A graceful and elegant memoir of this great bishop
has been written with much skill and judgment by his esteemed
friend the Very Rev. Canon Hoare, P.P.‚ Street, Co. West-
meath, and is to be found in that valuable book, entitled:
“Occasional Sermons‚ Addresses, and Essays by the Right
Rev. Dr. Oonroy.’' Ι beg to refer the reader to it for further
particulars regarding Dr. Conroy. I shall only add, that his
lordship was a man of those broad and elevated views which
much foreign travel generally imparts to cultivated minds.
He spoke the F rench and Italian languages with considerable
ease and fluency. He was what the French call un homme des
(fffaz'res. He had the reputation of being a good Latinist, and
*of writing pure English with much grace. He was also an
able theologian. The writer had the honour of being invited
to accompany his lordship, in 1874, to the Catholic University
*on the occasion of Doctors Magrath and O’Kane, students of
Clonliffe College, having offered themselves as candidates for
the degree of S. T. D. His Eminence Cardinal Oussen presided.
The rector, the Right Rev. Dr. Woodlock‚ had succeeded in get-
ting the Right Revs. Drs. Moran and Oonroy, together with Drs.
Molloy and Walsh of Maynooth‚ to come and object to the

jpropositions defended by the youthful aspirants to 2tsljie D.D.
