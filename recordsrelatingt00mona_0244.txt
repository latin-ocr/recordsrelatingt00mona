against His sovereign majesty by your past offences, you must-
expect to be sentenced to a prison, 110111 which you shall not 116·

therefore, has the holy Council 01 Τ16111 (1661316(1, 11131( ‘the

Con. Trid. Sess. 14a.

Since, then, dearest brethren‚ we are bound to do penance
all the days 01 01111116, with what religious zeal and fervour
should we not devote ourselves to this important duty during
the holy season 01 Lent, which is a time of general penance
throughout the entire Christian world ⁸? “Behold, now 18 the-
acceptable time3 behold now is the day 01 salvation.’'—2 Cor.
vi. 2. From these words 01 1116 Apostle it is plain that God

Such is the solemn and holy time 01 Lent, which is now
approaching. In this holy season, we, in a special manner,
commemorate the sufferings 01 Christ, and His sacred wounds
plead loudly in our 11611311 101· mercy and pardon. In the holy

“Where two or three are gathered together 111 my name, there
am 1 111 1116 1111(181 01 1116111.’ ’-Μ311. xviii. 20. 11 1116 prayers.
01 so small an assembly 01 the servants 01 God offer an agree-
