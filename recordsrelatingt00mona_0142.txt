was appointed Bishop of Clonmacnoise in 1725. His history
18 interesting. He was born in Dublin about 1679, and made
his studies at Louvain with the Domim‘cans, whose order 110
'had joined, and returned to Dublin about 1708, Τ110 penal
laws were then in full force. The Dominican Convents had
&been demolished. He was appointed to a curacy in St. J ames'
Parish. Subsequently, having procured a site for a church in
Bridge Street, he erected a commodious chapel thereon, and
>the Dominicans, for many years afterwards, carried on their
apostolic labours with great success within its sacred walls.
About that time the Dominican Nuns were expelled from
‘their loved cloisters in Galway to make place for lewd soldiers.
They had no place to fix their abode as a community, and offer
up their prayers 01 praise and reparation. They were obliged
-03011 to seek a refuge in the homes of their youth with their
own families. This fact touched the heart of Father Stephen,
and after conquering the main difficulties in the way of the
erection of his chapel at Bridge Street, he devoted himself
heart and soul to procure a conventual home for his outcast
›sisters of Galway. It was not long until he found for them,
notwithstanding the intolerance 01 the times, a resting-place
>at Fisher’s Lane. Afterwards he succeeded in procuring for
-them a more desirable habitation 111 ChanneH-Row‚ Dublin.
