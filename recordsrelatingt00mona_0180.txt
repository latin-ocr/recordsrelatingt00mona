had only been about one month at Maynooth, when he was
examined before Oommissioners appointed by his Majesty, to
inquire into the doctrine taught at Maynooth, and, indeed, 111
the whole Catholic Ohurch. The depth and variety of his
information3 his lucid, masterly, statements of the Catholic
doctrines3 his correct and satisfactory exposition of the Gallican
and Ultramontane theories; his admirable definition of the
Papal authority, and the logical precision. and accuracy of 1118
replies to all the various questions put to him on that occasion,
have been the theme of admiration, even by those most hostile
to his creed. On the death of 1118 dear friend, the Right Rev.
Dr. Magauran, in 1829, he was called on to preside over 1118
native diocese, and was consecrated bishop on the 30th of
November in that year.

Dr. MacHale preached the consecration sermon 111 Bally-
mahon, where the ceremony took place. They had been great
friends since Dr. O'Higgins’ brilliant display at the Concursus,
after which the celebrated Dr. Doyle said: “ It is a great
blessing for the Irish Ohurch to have such a man as Dr.
O'Higgins on the staff 01 the Maynooth professors.’'

Dr. MacHale afterwards, in his letters to Lord Shrewsbury,
wrote the following remarkable words :-—“ Dr. O’Higgins is the
best authority 011 0011011 Law in the British dominions.’'

Some years after his accession to the Episcopacy he com-
menced erecting a magnificent cathedral in Longford, 011 edifice
01 the purest Grecian architecture, upon which nearly AE40‚000
have been expended, and not yet* fully completed.

The following description of it was written by the bishop
himself, and read in the churches throughout the Diocese 111
October, 1841. In that pastoral he stated that the Cathedral
was 111 0 state of great forwardness, that the priests of the
Diocese had subscribed to it most generously, that he would
visit in person every parish in the Diocese during the coming
winter, and enrol the names 01 contributors, and sums sub-
scribed by them, in the Diocesan Register, and that the bishop
and his clergy will offer the Holy Sacrifica once a year and for
ever, for the temporal and spiritual welfare of the subscribersz—
