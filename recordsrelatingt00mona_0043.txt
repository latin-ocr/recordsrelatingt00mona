Ltos-ARD-ABHLA. 23

Esq, J.P.‚ D.L., resides there 111 a magnificent mansion.
Hospitable, kind, courageous, princely and truly Catholic‚ he
is a noble representative of the O'Ferrall chieftainS.

1541. November 14, Patrick Mac Mahon succeeded. ‘⁴ Die
140 N ov., 1541, referente R. D. Cardle Gambara, S.D.N. providit
ecclesiae Ardachaden. in Hibernia, vacanti per obitum Ronci
(sic) olim Episcopi Ardachaden„ extra Romanam Curiam de-
functi, de persona Patritii Machman (Mac Mahon) ordinis
fratrum minorum professoris, in presbyteratus ordine constituti.
Absolvens, etc.’'—Barberini and Vatican.

Sir J ames Ware placed the succession of Dr. Mac Mahon in
1553, when Richard Ferral died. This Richard Ferral had
restitution of temporalities in J uly, 1541, but was not conse-
crated until after the 2211(1 of April, 1542, 011 which day George
Oromer,A1-chbishop of Armagh, issued a Commission to any
three Catholic bishops of Ireland to consecrate him. This
appointment of Ferral was ignored at Rome3 and on Queen
Mary's accession Mac Mahon was restored to temporalities.
There is extant, in the London State Pap er Office, a bull of
Pop e Pius V. for deprivation of Patrick Mac Mahori (Patritius
Magmathgamma) for simony, non· -residence, leaving his cathe-
dral in ruins, Qc. The bull 1s dated from St. p’,Peters Rome,
January 26,1568. (State Pap ers, Elizabeth, p. 362). This
bull, or rather brief, may havep been a forgery, or obtained by
fraud. In Strype’s “ Life of Parker, ” edition of 1711, appen-
dix No. lxxxviii„ is printed a letter 110111* ‘Malachias quondam
Aimdachaden Episcopus Hibernusj’ to the Privy Council. In
this letter, which 1s dated‘ ‘Ex Marseolsey‚ 28 Februarii, 1572,”
the‘ ‘quondam'’ bishop Malachy confessyes to have been 01100
111 papistical superstition, but ‘⁶ ex ignoiantia potius quam
malitia. ’⁷ He promises loyalty and obedience, especially in
matters of religion, to the Queen and her Deputy 111 Ireland.
Malachy, however, has no place in either the Papal or the Protes-
tant succession.

The death of Patrick Mac Mahon is placed in the year 1572,
probably because Queen Elizabeth,xv11t1no= fr om Windsm, on

the 5th November, 1572, gave directions 101 the appointment
of Garvey ,the Dean of Christ Chu10h‚“to the bis hop 110 of

But Gar& ey WLS not appointed. On the 13th of June, 1576,
