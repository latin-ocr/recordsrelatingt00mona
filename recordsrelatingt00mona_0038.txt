18 Drocnsn OF ARDAGH.

however, the Holy See proclaimed him Bishop of Ardagh, in a
Consistory, held on the 4th December, 1518. He was permitted
to retain his former canonry and benefice at Olonmacnoise on
account of the poverty of the Diocese of Ardagh. He died
about the year 1540. Ware here sets down Richard Ferrall and
Lisach F errall as his successors. But in that he erred; for the
former. although at one time Abbot of Granard, was only an
usurper, and the latter was schismatical, having obtained his
appointment from Elizabeth. However‚ being dynasts of
Annally they caused much confusion, disorder, and loss of lay
as well as ecclesiastical property in Ardagh.

The illustrious family of the O'Ferralls of Annally gave not
only to the ecclesiastical but also to the military profession
many distingushed and brave membersf‘* They were the chief
patrons of religion in the territory of their ancient sept, and
during the troubled period of the Consederation some of them
rendered noble services to the Catholic religion, both in the
senate and in the camp. In the worst and most trying days
of our sad history some of this noble house hesitated not to
ascend the scaffold and give the strongest proof in a man's

THE O'FARRELL MARTYRS.

THE REv. FATHERs LAURENCE O'FARRELL AND BERNARD
O’FARRELL, O.P.

These two appear to have been brothers and were of the
ancient family of O'Farrell. Of Father Laurence, Dominick de
Rosario remarks, that he was educated at Lisbon, and was sub-
sequently Prior of their college there. De Burgo says that
Father Bernard was Predicator Generalis of the Order. De
Burgo and F ontana give the following account of their
martyrdom :—

“ They were seized at early mom, whilst praying in the
church of their native convent, Longford, which had been
abandoned by the brethren on account of the violence of the
persecution. Father Bernard was at once overwhelmed by the
persecutors with more than four and twenty deadly wounds‚

ὕ In the memorable but disastrous battle given by Bishop MacMahon, in
1650, to Coote and Venables, not far from Letterkenny, Lieutenant-General
O'Ferrall, as well as Henry O'Neill, fought with singular bravery, but were
obliged to sound a retreat before sunset. Among the killed on the side of the

Irish were eighteen Captains of the O'Ferrall family. Lieutenant-General
O’Ferrall escaped.
