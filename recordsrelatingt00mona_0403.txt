(sP.,11-e1and. 586. V01.228‚ 14.)

THE HUMBLE PETITION OF JAMES O’FERRALL.

Sheweth, that the Commissioners for Irish Causes have
certified to the Lords of the Privy Council, in the controversy
depending between the inhabitants of the County of Longfoi‘d
and Sir Francis Shane, Knt„ concerning 120 rent-beeves,
challenged to be due, issuing out of the Manor of Granard, as
may appear by their certificates, whereas heretofore the inhabi-
tants never paid more than 536 Irish, per annum. Petitioner‚
thinks himself and the inhabitants rather charged and bur-
thened than cased and relieved3 in respect, they have already
paid ,1:400 sterling for arrearageS, and yet are not acquitted of
3600, being the rest of the arrearages by him challenged, and
in respect that beeves are overrated, and in regard there is as
much of the land out of which the said rent was issuing‚ come
to the King’s hands, by the attainder of the tenants thereos, as
yields 5823 sterling, per annum 3 and that Sir Francis has been
possessed, during the last rebellion‚ and is yet possessed of the
demesnes of Granard, which heretofore‚ had been in the posses-
sion of the said inhabitants, and out of which the said rent was
principally issuing.

Prays, that the King may be pleased to discharge the
inhabitants of the arrearages incurred during the waste and
>depopulation of the county, and to accept for them as much rent
out of the said manor as Sir Francis payS‚ and thereby draw
the dependency of the inhabitants to him, as it has formerly
been; the rather because the Deputy and Council of Ireland
had, by several letters, certified their opinion to be accordingly,
and because the King may give Sir Francis some other satis-
{action in lieu thereos.

Prays, that the controversy depending between the inhabi—
tants, and the heirs and executors of Sir N icholas Malby, may
be speedily despatched, and that they may be discharged of the
arrearages and growing rents3 yielding to the King as much
as is yielded out of any plough land of like survey, chargeable
to the King in Ireland.
