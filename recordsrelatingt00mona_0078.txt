58 mocnsn OF ARDAGH.

year 1125 the following statement :—“ Operimentum factum et

optimum tectum et istud tectum integre super ecclesiam cathe-

dralem lapideam magnam Ardmachanam postea totum tegulis

coopertum a Celso vicario Patricii‚ in trigessimo anno supra

centessimum, a quo non fuit tegulis contectum totum.'' AJ).

1125, Four Masters : “ Quinto Id. J anuarii operimentum factum

et tectum integrum factum supra ecclesiam cathedralem lapi-

deam magnum Ardmachanam, postea totum tegulis coopertum a

Celso Vicario Patritii, in trigessimo anno supra centessimum ex

quo non fuit tegulis opertum totum usque ad id.'’ And Colgan
writes, Aa). 1125 :—“ Quinto Idus J an. tegulis integre con-

tecta et restaurata est ecclesia Cathedralis Ardmacana per sanctum
Celsum Archiepiscopum postquam per annos centum triginta
non nisi ex parte fuisset contecta.'' Hence it follows that the
great church 01 Armagh, burned in 995, was a stone building‚

and remained without a roof for one hundred and thirty years.

It also follows that it was a church of considerable magnitude.

This statement is confirmed by the Four Masters and Colgan, in
his “ Acta Sanctorum,'' cap. 14 ; also in the Annals of Armagh,

where we are told that Gelasius, Archbishop of Armagh, erected
a lime-kiln of enormous size for the purpose 01 repairinq, not
building‚ the churches. A.D. 1145: “A lime—kiln, which was
sixty feet every way, was erected opposite Eamhain-macha by
Gillamacliag, successor of St. Patrick. and Patrick's clergy in
general.'' In the Annals 01 Ulster it is written, A.D. 839 :-
“ Oombustio Ardmachae cum Nosocomiis (zze. oratoriis), et eccle-

siis lapideis suis.'' The Annals 01 the F our Masters record the

same sad event as committed by the Danes in the same year,

and use the Irish word Damhliag. Now, the best Irish scholars
admit this word to signify a stone structure, in fact, a stone
church. The Annals 01 Clonmacnoise, at the year 837, tell us
01 the same burning, and use the same Irish word. Oolgan,

ΑΛ). 839, writes: “Ardmacha cum sua Basilica aliisque sacris
aedibus incenditur per N orthmanos.”

Now Irish writers on such subjects as that under considera-
tion have used the Latin words ecclesia, templum, Basilica, to
express what the word Damhliag does in the Irish language,
but never to express a wooden building. The best Irish scholars
have also used Oill, egleis or ecleis Tempull Regles, as synony-
mous with Damhliag and ecclesia and Basilica. They used a
different word, i.e., Duirteach‚ to express another class 01 build—
ings, vla, wooden, which is rendered into Latin by the word
oratorium. Hence the conclusion follows that not only where
the early Irish churches are referred to by our Annalists, over

the words Damhliag‚ Cill, ecleis, tempull, we are to infer the
structure was 01 stone. ³
