out on horseback to Grellach Eillfi, a place situate in the
northern part of Westmeath, where he had heard the monarch
was staying. By strategy he gained access to his presence ancl
struck Tuathal in the breast with his spear and killed him.
Needless to add, Maelmora himself fell immediately on the same
spot, a victim on the one hand to his own mistaken devotion and
heroism in the cause of his chieftain‚ and on the other hand to
the fidelity in discharge of duty of one of the monarch's body—
guard. As soon, however, as Dairmid's friends heard of the
king’s death, they sought him and proclaimed him Monarch of
Erinn. Here one may refiect upon what Seneca has written,
Oct. 456 ε “ Ferrum tuetur principem. Sed. melius fides.”
Yes, the highest authority has said, “ Fides tua te salvum fecit.''
It has been beautifully written also:

“ What sword or power equal to this ¹2
And he that has that is clad in complete steel,
And, like a quivered nymph with arrows keen,
May trace huge forests and unharbored heaths,
Infamous 111113 and sandy perilous wilds.''

Romantic and fanciful as this account of the origin of Clon-
macnoise may at first sight appear, there are not wanting his·
torical proofs amply sufficient to convince the most sceptical of
its veracit .

I shall {dvance only two, as I consider them quite sufficient.

The first is to be found in a Tract on the foundation of Clon-
macnoise in the Leabhar Buidhe Lecain, which contains the
narrative already given. This manuscript may be seen in Trinity

 

Ciaran proceeded to Aran to receive lessons of heavenlv wisdom from St-
Enda. He there saw in vision a large fruitful tree transplanted to the middle
of Erin. It sheltered the whole island, and its fruit was borne beyond the sea
which surrounded Erin‚ and it seemed as if all the birds of the world would
come to taste of its fruit. St. Enda explaining this vision said to him, “ The
great tree which thou hast seen is thyself, Erin shall be full of thy honour, and
the shadow of thy grace shall protect the whole island, and multitudes shall
be satiated with the fruits of thy fasting and prayers : g0, then, 111 the name
of God, to the banks of the Shannon, and found thy church there.” Before
bidding farewell, these two great saints erected a cross on the coast of Aran as
a pledge of their undying spiritual friendship.

After leaving Aran, Ciaran met with a poor man who solicited an alms.
Having nothing else to bestow, he gave his casula to him. Proceeding thence
to Inis-Cathaig, St. Senan, admonished by God, went forth to meet him, and
giving him a casula. said, “It is not meet that a priest should travel without
his cowl.⁷' St. Ciaran afterwards, from Clonmacnoise, sent back the casula to
Senan, and in after times it was preserved as a priceless relic in Inis-Cathaig.

The first church erected by Ciaran was at Isell—Ciaran‚ which place was
presented to him by Cobhthach, son of Brecan. It was here that one day
while sowing corn in a field, Ciaran threw into the bosom of a poor man who
asked an alms, a handful of corn which was at once changed into gold. From
Isell-Ciaran our saint proceeded to Inis-Ainghin‚ i.e., “Hare Island,” in Lough
Ree, and many disciples flocked thither to him. There was a religious man on
that island, of the name of Daniel, and he was a Briton. He was tempted by
