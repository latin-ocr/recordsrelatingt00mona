Sulpice, where he remained for two years. Having mastered
the French language, and fortified by the Sulpician spirit, 11οι
set out for the colony, and arrived there in 1827. The late-

protection. The first place where he began his Apostolic-
labours was the little quarter 01 Carenage, where the ever-to-
