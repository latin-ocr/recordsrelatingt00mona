Our divine Redeemer in communicating to His Apostles the
heavenly mission He Himself had received 110111 His Eternal
Father, addressed them as follows ε “ All power is given to Me
in heaven and in earth. Going, therefore, teach ye all 1101310110,ι
baptizing them in the name 01 1110 F ather, and 01 1110 Son, and
01 1110 Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things, whatso-
ever I have commanded you ε and behold, I am with you all
days, even to the consummation 01 1110 world.'' *

In this sublime commission our divine Lord guarantees a
double perpetuity to His Church—-a perpetuity 01 His own ever
blessed assistance to His Apostles in the exercise 01 their>
ministry3 and, consequently‚ a perpetuity 01 11101 ministry in
those who succeeding them would continue their mission to the
end 01 ages. Accordingly, as in the beginning, “ He gave some
Apostles, and some Prophets, and other some Evangelists, and
other some Pastors and Doctors, 101 theperfecting 01 1110 saints,
101 1110 work 01 1110 ministry, 101· 1110 edifying 01 1110 body 01
Christ.'' † So, also, has He continued to provide a never-failing
succession 01 divinely-appointed labourers in the various offices
01 1110 ecclesiastical ministry.

But whilst vocations to a state so privileged and holy must
proceed immediately 110111 God, it belongs to the episcopal office
to prove that those who present themselves are so called. It is
101 1110 Bishops “appointed by the Holy Ghost to rule the
Ohurch 01 G0d‚'' ‡ to watch and see that “no man take this-
honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron
was.''§ No “hireling” must be allowed to climb over the
wall. All entrance must be by “ the door‚'’ and by permission
01 the duly-appointed “porter.'' Η They alone who enter the ⁷
sold 01 Christ, in this manner are the shepherds, divinely oom-
missioned‚ inheriting the spirit 01 1110 Supreme Pastor, and ever
ready like Him to lay down their 1110 101 the sheep He has-
purchased with His own blood.
