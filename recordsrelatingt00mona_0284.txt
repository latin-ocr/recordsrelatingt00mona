line intellect, illustrating the saying, “ How beautiful is the
death 01 1110 just.'' Consecrated on the 29111 01 June, 1853, by
the Most Rev. Archbishop (now his Eminence Oardinal) Oullen,
the illustrious deceased had concluded the fourteenth year 01
1118 episcopacy, all but eight days. The Most Rev. Dr. Kilduff
was one who would be acoounted exalted even amongst the most
distinguished. He was remarkable alike 101· mental power and
profound scholarship, combined with a far-seeing judgment
and great administrative capacity. Humble in his own estima-
tion, 110 was held in the highest esteem by all who knew him,
and with all the grace 01 3 Christian gentleman he was most
distinguished 101· 1110 meek gentleness 01 1118 nature, the kind
forbearance 01 1118 manner, and 101· 11131 abiding charity which
endureth all things 101· God’s sake. It was in the hidden 1110
01 1110 80οᾱ 111811οΡ 1118 true greatness was to be recognised—in
his undying love 101· 1110 poor, in his zeal 101· 1110 welfare 01 1118
flock, in his countless acts 01 mercy and seff-sacrfficing benevo-
lence, and in his deep humility. Amongst his clergy and his
people he was regarded as an indulgent and fond parent, and
he lived “ in the heart 01 hearts '' 01 1118 flock, who now mourn
his loss in silent sorrow. And it should be so. He who was
the stay 01 1110 11011101088 and the destitute, the father to the
widow and the orphan, the instructor 01 1110 ignorant, the 0011-
soler 011110 sorrowing and afflicted, is no more. In him the
sinner has lost the stern, though kind reprover, the weak their
great protector, and all, a brilliant example 01 1110 height 01
Christian perfection to which human nature could aspire.
Born, 38 well as we can learn, about the year 1820, 01 most
respectable parents, in the neighbourhood 01 Α11110110, 31 311
early age the future bishop gave indic-ations 01 1110 intellectual
power 101· which he was afterwards so highly distinguished.
As he grew in years he grew in virtue, and having expressed a
desire to enter into the sacred ministry, all his studies were
directed to that object. Having received a liberal preliminary
education, he proceeded to 1110 Irish College at Rome, then
under the presidency 01 1118 Eminence the Cardinal Archbishop
01 Dublin. His 0011081310 career was most brilliant, and soon
after his ordination he joined the Vincentian community. As
an humble missionary priest‚ he officiated in the Ohurch 01 St.
Peter, Phibsborough, and worked with untiring zeal 101· 1110
instruction 01 youth, and 101· 1110 promotion 01 religion amongst
rich and poor. Even the obscurity 01 1110 little district church
in which he toiled, apparently unknown, could not conceal
brilliant virtues such as his, and, though sitting 131· below the
salt, the Master 01 1110 Feast called him up to the place 01
honour and high dignit-y. On the death 01 1110 Most Rev, Dr.
