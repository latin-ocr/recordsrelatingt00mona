EPISCOPAL SUCCESSION IN OLONMACNOISE. 79

Clonfandlagh‚ Clonderigh, Olonagher, Cumrml, Cloghran, Clon-
cragh, Ragbran, and Clonefin. But most of the possessions
belonging to them got, from time to time, into lay hands, and
particularly into those of the Malones and Mac Coghlans. The
Archdeaconry of Olonmacnoise subsisted in Bishop Montgom-

Dalaghan was presented to it, on the l3th J anuary, in the tenth
year of the reign of Elizabeth, and a mandate issued to give
him a stall in the choir, and a voice in the Chapter. A house
and garden near to Clonmacnoise Church were apptirtenant to
the Archdeaconry.

EPISOOPAL SUOOESSION IN OLONMAONOISE.

Our Annalists do not agree regarding the year in which the*
Abbey of Olonmacnoise was converted into a Oathedral ; the Four·
Masters, the Chronicon Scotorum, and others, have given us an
uninterrupted succession of its AbbotS. But it is not so with its⁴
Bishops. Some high authorities, indeed, expressly say, that St.
Ciaran was Bishop of Olonmacnoise. In the Registry of Olon-
macnoise it is so asserted, and Lynch, in his MSS. History of
the Episcopal Succession, mentions this fact. The following ex-
tract has been copied from Mac Firbis's translation of the Re-
gistry of Clonmacnoise, preserved in the British Museum :—

“ The life of Kyran thus sett downe that the best bloode have choosen their·
bodyes to be buried in Cluainemacnoise, for that Kyran had such power,
being a lzoly Bishop, through the will of God, that what souls harboured in
the bodies buried under that dust may never be adjudged to Damnation,
wherefore those of the same blood have divided the churchyard amongst
themselves, by the consent of Kyran and his holy clearks.'’

Assuming it to be a fact that St. Ciaran was a Bishop, there
is no need of further inquiry into the original date of the Cathe-
dral, nor will there be much difficulty in setting forth an unin-
terrupted series of his successorS, as far as the penal times. On
the other hand, if we assume that there was no Bishop at Clon-
macnoise until Baitan (O'Oormac), who died in 663, and that
his immediate successor was J oseph, whose obit. is fixed at 839,
as some of our Annalists affirm3 we are forced to the conclu-
sion that, whilst every town, and even village, in Ireland had a
Bishop of its own, according to the practice established by St.
Patrick, Clonmacnoise, with all its greatneSS, was an exception
to the general usage. It would, therefore, seem reasonable to
