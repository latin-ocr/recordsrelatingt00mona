DR. KnLDUFF. 275

fgates of Hell shall never prevail against it. We have, more-
=0ver, most Holy Father, a great confidence, nay, a most certain
hope, that the storm which has been permitted to rage for a
while against the Holy See, shall not prevail to the detriment
*of your full and entire liberty and perfect freedom from all
:secular control in governing the Ohurch of God; and that the
:same all-ruling Providence, which, for so many ages past, has
watched with special care over the States of the Church will,
in its own good time, calm the tempest and restore peace, order,
and tranquillity. Meanwhile, we shall continue to watch all
'your trials with the deepest interest ; and be assured, most Holy
F ather, that every indignity offered to your august person and
throne, and every attempt made by those enemies of God and
man against your sacred and inalienable rights shall increase ὴ
the intense grief and burning indignation of your most affec-
tionate and most devoted children. Our voices shall be united.
with those of our Brethren throughout the world, in denounc-
ing every sacrilegious attempt to wrest from your Holiness
§your ancient tempora] dominion, so legitimately and so provi-
dentially acquired‚ and so long exercised by an illustrious line
‹of Pontiffs for the best interests of God’s Holy Religion, for
the universal progress and civilization of the human race. Nor
shall we cease to offer up our constant and earnest supplications
to the God of J ustice‚ that He may speedily deliver His Vicar
on earth from the foul machinations of his enemies, who are
alike the enemies of God's Ohurch, of truth, religion, and
justice. Finassy, prostrate at the feet of your Holiness, we
¹orave your Apostolioal Benediction on your Holiness's most
humble, most devoted, and most obedient children and servants.

Here followed the signature of bishops, priests, and promi-
nent members of the laity.

 

The following letter from Dr. N ewman‚ now His Eminence
Cardinal N ewman‚ written to the Right Rev. Dr. Kilduffi before
his resignation of the Rectorship of the Catholic University,
-cannot fail to be interesting, as indeed is everything coming from
the pen of the most gifted writer of our English lang-uage—
to whom the Gatholic Ohurch in Great Britain may point—and
it should be so in a especial manner to the admirers os the
character and memory of Dr. Kilduff, in that it shows the
esteem and confidence reposed in him by Dr. N ewman.
