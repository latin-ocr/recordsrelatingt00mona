The front of the Cathedral has not been yet completed
through want of means. Dr. Woodlock has been and is very
anxious about it, and has already had plans and specifications
drawn by George Ashlin, Esq.‚ O.E.‚ exhibiting six magnificent⁴
Ionic columns, enclosing 3 8113010118 11011100. The depression of‘
the times, however, has prevented his lordship commencing this.
great and costly work up to the present. Let us hope that Dr.
Woodlock will be spared to witness its entire completion, and.
thus add one more to many enduring monuments in Ardagh and
Clonmacnoise, with which his name shall be connected for·

ever.

In a published record of collections relating to the most-
distinguished ecclesiastics belonging to the Diocese of Ardagh,
it appears to the compiler fitting to introduce the names of those·-
of her children who, having been 1011 by the Spirit 01 God to
face the 1101118 01 the sea3 the 1101118 01 travel 10 distant and.
strange lands; the 1101118 01 semi-civilized and barbarous 13008,
31111 1110 1101118 01 1801311011 110111 111011 own brethren in the-
ministry, together with the natural regrets of absence from one’s-
own country and one's own family and friends, were afterwards
safely conducted by that same unerring Spirit through the
desert, to the mountain of the Lord, and there clothed in the-
bright, shining, and pure robes 01 the Bishops of God’s Holy
Ohurch. Three such Apostles went out from Ardagh in the—
spring-time 01 their lives, and afterwards shcd lustre on the-
diocese that gave them birth.

Dr. Conroy. and the new Chapel of Bassymacormack, Parish of Longford, are:

also the works of Dr. W oodlock.
