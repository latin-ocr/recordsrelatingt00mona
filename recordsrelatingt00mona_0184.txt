took such a leading part on the right side in this great question,
which is stilla standing grievance. The following are some of
the letters written from Rome by Dr. O'Higgins in reference to
this monstrous injustice forced upon an old Catholic nation of
high renown in the educational world before the coming of

My DEAR Lora),—

Your Lordship's kind letter of the 26th of August
reached me here in due time. I was delighted in reading every
portion of it, but inore particularly that which had reference to
youisvggffigpiuggfflg {zetzzlldtdllgtegaitldedo great service to the
cause of truth, and yours has given much satisfaction to His
Holiness. We have at length left our final eoepose‘ in print with
the Pope and the Cardinals. The case will be discussed on the
25th of this month in a full Congregation, and the opinion2of
their Eminences will be laid before the Pope on the following
Sunday. “ Pendente lite,'' it would be rash to speak with
absolute certainty3 still I venture to say, the deoision will be

fully to our wishes.
You can scarcely conceive the unjustifiable means resorted

to by our blind and unprincipled opponents. Everything that
systematic lying, or British intrigue, as well as the base con-
duct of false brethren could effect, was called unserupulously
into requisition3 but the justice of the cause and the prayers
of the faithful have, so far, baffled our enemies and left us high

in the ascendant.
All will depend on the Pope's Placet on the 25th. May it

be inspired by the Holy Ghost 1 Your next meeting will be of
transcendent importance, and I ardently hope that your Lord-
ship and the other worthy Prelates of the province will be in
Dublin several days before the general assembling of the
PrelateS. This will be absolutely necessary, in order to make
due preparations to meet the common enemy. Probably you
will be assailed by menaces, flattery‚ or delusive promises, and
all must be opposed with discernment‚ courage‚ and perseverance.
It would be well, if not necessary, to express deep sympathy
with the calumniated, persecuted, and half-starved Irish people,
as also with His Holiness in his great difficulties. As to the
claims of the truth-tefling, high-minded, and paternal Whigs on
the approval, direct or indirect, of the Irish clergy, the extent
of such claims will be found in. their government of Ireland
