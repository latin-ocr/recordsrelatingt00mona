the O’Neill. Now, St. Moel and his clerics resided at Ardagh,
in the territory of Manu, the son of King Niall of the Nine
Hostages, and it may, therefore, be fairly deduced that St. Moel ’
performed the religious profession of Bridget in his own church
at Ardagh. I have reserved the strongest argument for last,
namely, the Bollandists hold that St. Mel professed St. Bridget
in his own church at Ardagh. The Right Rev. Dr. Woodloek
has written lessons, propria onmem, for the Feast of St. Mel,
which were approved at Rome, and this opinion is adopted in
these lessons as the correct one*

THE CATHEDRAL AND COLLEGE OF ARDAGH.

Longford being of late years the chief town in the Diocese
of Ardagh, the magnificent new Cat'hedral of St. Mel was com-
menced there by Bishop O'Higgins, more than forty years ago.
It was completed, nearly as it now stands, by the late Bishop
Kilduff. Previously to their episcopate, Athlone and Bally-
mahon had been alternately the chief seat of the bishop of this
diocese. Dr. Brady, for instance, resided chiefly in Athlona
whilst Doctors Magauran and O'Higgins resided at Bally-
mahon, where both were interred. The remains of Dr.
O’Higgins were afterwards removed to the vaults of the
Cathedral at Longford, and fittingly so: as it was he who had
conceived its design and laid its foundation stone. He
did not live to witness the erection of its walls except in
part3 but having projected the great work and seen it
partly built, 116 was called to his reward. To him a great
successor arose, who fully realized the conception of his pre-
decessor. Dr. Kilduff not only lived to witness its completion
almost as it now is, but also laid the foundation stone of the
Oollege of St. Mel. Having concentrated his mind and heart
from the beginning of his episcopal career upon these two great
works, 116 took up his residence at Longford, soon after his
consecration‚ where he uninterruptedly lived until his premature
death. The beautiful high altar, now standing in this CathedraL
was erected as a memorial to commemorate his zeal and virtues.
Thellate Bishop, Dr. Oomoy, contributed somewhat to complete

Rome had them revised by one of the present Bollandists. Fr. (16 Genet‚ SJ.
