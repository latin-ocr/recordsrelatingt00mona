CLONMACNOISE, ΟΒ, ΤΗΕ SEVEN CHURCHES. 39

Every stone, however, that remains in her crumbling walls,
the dust and clay you press beneath your feet, and even the fresh
and in vigorating western breezes that san this dismantled, Abbey,
whisper something of superhuman and heavenly grandeur.
Here prelate and king, abbot and monk, learned professor and
talented student, prince and peasant, sleep together in their
quiet graves. And here the lines written by a great but unhappy
poet regarding the greatest centre of all that is good and great,
whether in ancient or modern times, may not inaptly be quoted,
and, with some justification, fittingly applied:

‘⁴ What are our woes and sufferance ? Come and see
The cypress, hear the owl, and plod your way
O'er steps of broken thrones and templeps. Ye !
YVhose agonies are evils of a day.
A world is at your feet as fragile as our clay.
Clonmacnoise of the Sehools ! there she stands
Childless and crownless, in her voiceless woe ;
An empty urn within her withered hands,
Whose sacred dust was scattered long ago.''

There is and must always be an attractive and sympathetic
power about this venerable ruin, studded as it is with so many
memorials of renowned men, and monuments of the praises of
God, which once resounded through its lonely walls. And so I
propose to give in this paper a brief sketch of the origin of
Olonmacnoise, and afterwards to notice some of the leading men
and events connected with the history of this sacred spot. In
doing so 1 do not put forward any pretence to originality. I
do not propose or pretend to produce nova, and anxious though
I should be to bring forth the vetera wore, I have not any well-
founded hope of doing so.

This ground has been already gone over by many dis-
tinguished and gifted writers, who, having made a judic-,icus
collection of historical facts, clothed them in a garb too attractive
and fascinating for me to hope for a moment to successfully
imitate. In one thing, however, I will not place myself second
to any writer, be he never so gifted, and that is love and venera-
tion for Clonmacnoise, and all the goodness this word embodies
and recalls. Reverentially saluting thee, Ο Glonmacnoise‚ of so
many saints and doctors, kings and nobles, Ι ask then what is
the meaning of thy name and the origin of thy greatneSS.

It may be observed in the beginning that Olonmacnoise was
known by several names. It was called Druim—Tipraid, “the
hill in the centre‚’' or the hil] of Tipraid. The reason appears
to be that in 779 the king of Connaught was called Tipraid. In
927 the ruling Abbot at Olonmacnoise was also called Tipraid.
So far then for the application of this word to the sacred spot.
It was also called Dunkeranensis, the enclosed place of Kieran
