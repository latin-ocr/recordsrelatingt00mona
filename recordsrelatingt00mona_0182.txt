162 DIOCESE OF ARDAGH

The Press teemed with the most virulent abuse, and the Govern—
ment was called on most peremptorily to crush so dangerous-
an incendiary‚ and extinguish at once the formidable agitation.
O'Connell warmly defended the character of his friend, Dr.
O’Higgins‚ and repaid the invectives of his enemies in his own
scathing sarcasm. Everyone may remember the withering satire
with which helashed Lord Beaumont for his attack on the Bishop
of Ardagh‚ and the fiattering panegyric with which he consoled
the Prelate. Nor did the threats of power much affect the good
bishop3 instead of shrinking into obscurity, as his enemies no
doubt expected, he defied the whole power of England to put
down the Repeal Agitation in the Diocese of Ardagh. “ They
may‚'’ said he, “ prohibit us from assembling under the canopy of
Heaven‚ but we will retire to our chapels to take counsel for the
freedom of our country and our faith, and should they pursue
us there, then—then—-then—Let echo answer them ἒ ”

When Ireland fell back prostrate and bleeding, and grief and
despondency descended upon the most sanguine, when the lamp
of the Liberator was quenched in gloom‚ the heart of the
prelate gradually gave way. His health sensibly declined
from the day of O'Gonnell's death, and though he tried at times
to raHy, he wanted the animation of hope3 the food of his
glory, the staple of his existence was gone. Dr. O’Higgins-
added the O to his name after O’C‘onnell's death. For months
before his demise‚ Dr. O'Higgins was seriously indisposed, and
after a painful and lingering illness, which he bore with great
patience, he departed this life on the 29th of J anuary, 1853, in.
the sixty-third year of his age.

It has been already stated that Dr. O'Higgins was deputed
by the Irish Bishops on more than one occasion to represent
them at Rome on controverted questions of great moment..
Such a question was the Academical Education Act, proposed
in 1847, for the acceptance of the Irish Hierarchy. But they
could not accept it. They considered it their duty to recom—
mend a Catholic University in imitation of Belgium. Their
action was approved at Rome. Hostile influences‚ however,
were brought to bear upon the Roman Court and with some
appearance of truth by Lords Minto and Shrewsbury. Diffi--
culties of considerable magnitude arose out of their united repre--
sentations at Rome. A letter from Cardinal Fransoni to the>
Irish Bishops‚ recommending ‘moderation and unity followed.
This admonitory document led to energetic action in various-
quarters. A meeting of some of the bishops was held a few
weeks after the appearance of a letter, dated l9th March, 1848,
and addressed by Lord Clarendon to Dr. Murray, Archbishop
of Dublin. At that meeting Drs. MacHale and O'Higgins were
