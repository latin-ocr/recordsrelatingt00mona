FIRsr PASTORAL LETTER OF DR. KILDUFF, Issussn IN 1853.

Pastorccl Address of the Rz'qlzt Reverend Dr. Isilclcgff 2‘0 tlte catholic
Oleryy and Laity of tlte Diocese of Ardagylz.

Having come to take amongst you the position to which
Divine Providence has been pleased, notwithstanding my great
unworthiness, to call me, I desire to share with you some of
those anxious thoughts and feelings which fill my mind in view
-of the serious cares and responsibilities that lie before me.

Though sprung from amongst you, I am almost a stranger
to you. On being promoted to the holy order of priesthood,
my inclinations led me to J oin an institute which permitted me
to combine the active duties of my ministry with the ad-
vantages of community life. In this state I was happy, and
happy should Ι be if permitted to persovere in it, labouring as
well as Ι could for the salvation of souls, and, at the same time,
profiting of the edifying example of my holy companions as
well as of the other advantages of such a condition of life for
my own sanctification.

It was, therefore, with unspeakable anguish that I re-
ceived the summons which called on me to abandon that state of

quiet and happy seclusion in which Ι was living, and to assume
’ the government of this extensive diocese. Neither remonstrance
nor resistance was of any avail. Ι was to have no will of my
own, except to conform to the will of the Supreme Pastor of
Christ’s sheepfold on earth, who, in the mode and manner of
my ffimssssssffntssssssf ssgvsssseffiefflssffssgsseg‘g‘'geg-,hren of the
Olergy, finding myself thus amongst you, what have I to say
to you, but that our ministry is one, that our responsibilities are
the same, and that you and I are to discharge a joint embassy
for Christ to the faithful of this diocese. Thus united in the
same holy cause, Ι am filled with consolation in the thought
that “being of one mind to one another'' and “loving one
another with brotherly love,” your intelligence and enlighten-
ment, your zeal and energy shall be to me a powerful aid, and
compensate for all that is defective in me. Our obligations,
though numerous and weighty, may be stated in a very few
words; they are to conduct, seed, (md defend that portion of the
flock of Christ committed to our joint care.

To CONDUCT THEM.·—In order to satisfy this obligation, we
are to' model our lives on the life of the Supreme Pastor, who
first practised, giving in himself the example of the sublime
virtues which he afterwards preached. In imitation of Him
