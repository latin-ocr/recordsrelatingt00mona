CLONMACNOISE AS A SCHOOL. 77

—quaedam gravis quaestio inter doctores in schola de Cluain—
micnois ventilaretur, et alii loci Patres, et viri doctrina et
auctoritate pollentes, adversam quaestionis partem, contravirum
Dei acriter tuerentur, legitur etiam Divus Paulus ejus partes
suscepisse, coram senioribus perorasse, et controversiam ad ejus
mentem decidisse.'' WVhatever may be thought of this, it is
*certain that 110 was the most learned man of his day in the
writings of St. Paul. His death is recorded at the 20th February,
792. This distinguished lecturer was, beyond all doubt, the
blessed Master Golgan‚ or Golcu, with whom Alcuin carried 00
a correspondence3 and one of the principal distinctions 01 his
life is to be found in the remarkable letter written to him b
Alcuin, and published by Golgan (Acta SE„ page 379). The
letter thus begins :—
“ Epistola Albini (cle. Alcuin) Magistri

Ad Colcum Lectorem in Scotia

Benedicto Magistro, et Pio Patri Colcuo

Alcuine humilis Levita salutem.”

This is a very remarkable letter, but rather too long to be
inserted here. It affords probable evidence that Alcuin was
once a pupil of Oolgan'S, for he styles him his master, his
father, and calls himself his son or disciple—“Ego filius tuus
et J oseph vernaculus tuus Deo miserante sani sumus et tui amici
toti.''

In this remarkable epistle, it is stated that he sent to his
beloved Colcu some 011 (probably olive), which was then very
scarce in Britain, and requested him to have it divided among
the bishops, in honour of God. He also sent, as a gift from
King Oharles, fifty 810108, to be distributed as alms, and. fifty
sicles of his own for the same purpose. This was an old Jewish
coin, said to be worth, when in silver, each, two shillings and
sixpence 01 our money; when in gold, about fifteen shillings.
A remarkable prayer 01 St. Colgan is to be found in the
“ Yellow Book 01 Lecain.'' It is entitled “ Oratio Colgani
Sancti.'' This prayer was translated into English, and pub-
lished in the “Irish Ecclesiastical Record.’' with appropriate
comments (Vol. I., No. 1, pp. 4, 12). The Invocation of Saints
is clearly contained in it. The major and minor orders of the
priesthood, the excellence of virginity, together with devotion
to the Blessed Mother of God and other dogmatic truths, are
also deducible from it. For this prayer see Appendix.

The connection 01 Α10010 with St. Colgan, imparts to his
position, character, and monastery, an especial glory.

Who was Alcuin ?—The most distinguished scholar in
Europe, in the eighth century. He was Rector of the Palatine
University‚ established by Oharlemagne, for the revival of
