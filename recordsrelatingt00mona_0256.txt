great a want, and our experience of this want renders us the
more anxious to have it speedily supplied.

Besides, the benefits of the Seminary are to be extended to
lay students, that they may be afforded an education in accord-
ance with the enlightenment of the age, and be brought up,
moreover, in the knowledge and observance of their religion as
Catholics. Our life, as holy Job declares, is a warfare on earth.
The condition of the Church in this world places her continually
in the battle-field; and the strifes of the age we live in, are
mainly those of adverse systems of: education. We are living
in a country in which great encouragement is given to systems
of education hostile to our saith, and opposed to the teaching of
-the Holy Catholic Church, systems calculated to leave children
without religion in this world. and to blast their hopes of hap-
piness in the next. The Institutions called the Queen’s Colleges
have been condemned, as you are aware, by the Holy See, as
intrinsically dangerous to the saith and morals of Catholic
students. It is our duty, it is the duty of the Pastors of the
F aithful in their respective parishes, and it is the essential duty
of parents with regard to their children, to preserve the rising
generation from these pernicious institutionS. And whilst we
withhold them from such a danger, we should endeavour, at

bined with a moral and religious training‚ which will make
them good Chrisdans, and obedient and dutiful children of the
>Holy Catholic Church.

Such is the work which I propose to your zeal and pious
generosity. You, Venerable Brethren of the Olergy, have
-already shown, by your munificent subscriptione, how highly you
appreciate its importance, and I am sure that your faithful
people, ever willing to correspond with the efforts of your zeaL
will co-operate with you in a holy rivalry for its accomplishment.

In thus seeking to obtain your combined co-operation, I
should earnestly wish to communicate to you all the conviction
with which my own mind is deeply impressed, namely—that
the task we have before us is not difficult of accomplishment.
‘The amount required is, indeed, considerable in itself3 but, it
could be easily shown, that a contribution, according to each
person's means, from all the parishes of the diocese, would more
than make up that amount. Let us, therefore, be animated
with the feeling that the undertaking we are about to engage
in, is one that we can accomplish; that it will not even press
inconveniently upon any individual, and that all that is required
is a generous effort of the diocese at large.

And here let me anticipate a difficulty which possibly may
stand in the way. It may occur to individuals to say, “the
