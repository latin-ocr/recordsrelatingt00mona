all be finished. And we are specially admonished that ‘⁴ unless.
the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.”‘
Ι feel therefore bound to look up on high, and with thankful
reverence bless and praise the divine bounty for the noble dis-
positions with which He has inspired you, and of which you.
have given such signal proof.

But, dearly beloved brethren‚ Ι shall avail myself of your·
generosity for another purpose. It is to derive eonfidence from
it with respect to what remains to be done in bringing this
great diocesan work to a final completion. Yes, dearly beloved,
in all simplicity I will say it : your past generosity—so prompt,
so universal, and so effective—is to me a pledge for the future.
Ι know the dispositions to which Ι address myself. Priests and

interest, and Ι am persuaded that in applying to you for ad-
ditional assistance, it is only necessary for me to be the»—
interpreter of the dispositions that pervade the entire diocese,
and to appoint the means for giving them effect. You regard
the work in which we are engaged as the House of God, and
you are animated by the great thought which inspired holy
David of old ε “ A house is prepared not for man, but for God.⁷'·
You regard it not as the church of a single parish, but as the
cathedral of the entire diocese. The vastness of its proportions,
and the splendour of its style, fill your souls with deli ght that you
have such an offering to present to the Most Hi gh for His dwell-
ing amongst us. So far from being dispirited by the length of'
time that it has been in progress, this is to you a motive for
speeding the good work to its completion. And instead of
complainin g of the repeated demands that have been made upon
yOU, your cheerful compliance with these demands only makes.
you the more willing to give, by persevering assistance, a
crowning effect to your untiring generosity.

How admirable these dispositions, but how still more ad-
mirable their operation and results! The word of a bishop
goes forth. It is taken up and repeated by a zealous and united
clergy to their faithful flocks through the length and breadth
of an entire diocese. It finds a response in every breast ; and
all are animated with a common sentiment, feeling that the
demand is on the part of the Almighty. A tribute is set on
foot, every one contributin g according to his means, even to the
widow, who, from her poverty, gives her humble mite. Ex-
hausted funds are again replenished3 and the good work, in
which all are interested, goes forward with as much spirit and
activity as if it had the treasure of anation to carry it on.

Ι feel, therefore, the langnage of entreaty must not be used.
