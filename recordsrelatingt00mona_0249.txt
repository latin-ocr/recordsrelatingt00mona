It is wholly unsuited to your spontaneous generosity, which
requires not to be evoked, but rather to be regulated in the
manner it is to be exercised. I, therefore, hope that Sunday, the
=3rd day of February next, will be found a convenient day for

v another J oint effort in the way of a simultaneous collection in

every parish in the diocese. The clergy are requested to give
due notice of it to their respective flocks‚ and to make such
arrangements as they will consider necessary for the occasion.-

They will explain to the faithful that, sharing in the erection
of the church, they will share also in all the good works that
will be performed in connection with it as long as it will exist,
and that the holy sacrifice will be specially celebrated for the
spiritual and temporal welfare of the subscribers every year,
within the octave of the Feast of St. Mel, the holy patron of
the diocese.

I will only add, that calculating on the results of that day,
I have not allowed the works to be suspended, nor in any way
retarded. I feel pressed, on the one side, by the necessity of
urging on the works to a speedy completion, as the old chapel
is a complete wreck3 and on the other, my confidence in the
results of the effort about to be made makes me feel as if the
means had already come to hand. Committing‚ then, all my
expectations to your generosity, I desire to remain, dearly be-
loved brethren in the love of our Lord J esus Christ and of His
Immaculate Mother, and under the invocation of our glorious

Patron,
Your ever devoted Servant in Christ,

Dearly Beloved Brethren in Christ,

We read in the Gospel that our Divine Redeemer‚
preaching to the multitudes who had flocked around Him to
hear from His blessed lips the truths of eternal life, addressed
them as follows: “ Which of you, having a mind to build a
tower, doth not first sit down and reckon the charges that are
