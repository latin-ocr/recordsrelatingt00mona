cises of mortification and penance. What may we not, then,
expect and hope for, dearest brethren, if, during this time, we
unite ourselves to them with a truly penitential spirit Ρ Will
not their fervent prayers, their fasts and. other penitential
austefities, add considerable weight to our poor endeavours?
God, seeing His whole Church in mourning, both priests and
people mortifying their bodies with fasting and abstinence, and
pouring forth their souls before Him in fervent and humble
prayer, will be easily moved to pity and compassion on poor
sinuers who pray‚ fast‚· aud repent in union with them. Let
me, then, exhort and conjure you, dearest brethren, to lay hold
on this acceptable time, to profit of these days of salvation.

However anxious we might be to enforce a strict observance
of fasting and abstinence according to the ancient discipline of
the Ohurch in this penitential season‚ we cannot be unmindful
of our poorer brethren, whose poverty‚ sufferings‚ and many
privations render almost their whole lives a perpetual Lent.
Influenced by the many calamities and afflictions which con-
tinue so heavily to press upon them, we are compelled to dis-
pense in the law of abstinence, and we do so in virtue of the
powers communicated to us by the Holy See. Whssst, there-
fore, the obligation of fasting remains in its full force, save in
cases excepted by the law, which your reverend brethren will
explain to your respective congregations‚ we permit the use of
flesh meat at dinner only on Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays (except the Satur-day of the Quatuor
Tenses), from the first Sunday of Lent, inclusive, to Palm
Sunday, inclusive. Flesh meat is prohibited during the first
and last weeks of Lent, and also on the other days not mentioned
above. Eggs are forbidden on Fridays, and on the first four
and last four days of Lent. Fish and flesh meat are never
allowed at the same meal. Milk and white meats of every
description are forbidden on Ash-Wednesday and on Wednes-
day and F riday in Holy Week. should any, on account of
ill-health, or some other just cause, require a further relaxation,
they may have recourse to their respective parish priests, who
are hereby authorised to grant the necessary dispensation.

I am sure it is unnecessary to remind you, dearest brethren‚
of the necessity of uniting with your fasting and abstinence an
interior spirit of penance, which consists of a hearty sorrow and
detestation of your past sins, with a firm resolution of sinning
no more. These interior dispositione constitute the soul and
essence of true penance 3 without them your fasting and absti-
nence and other exterior acts of mortifications would be only a
body without life, a shadow 01· appearance without the reality

or substance. For observe that this is the penance wlliich God
