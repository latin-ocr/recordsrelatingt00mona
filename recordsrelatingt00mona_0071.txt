CLONMACNOISE, ΟΒ THE SEVEN CHURCHES. 51

Tennyson, in his “King Arthur,'' translates it briefiy and
beautifully :—

“ Where falls not hail or rain or any snow,
Nor ever wind blows loudly.’'

Such places the pagans, of course, never found, except in Ι
poetic dreams. It is, however, certain that St. Oiaran and men
like him did establish‚ at Olonmacnoise and elsewhere, not such
an elysium as refined Grecian and cultured Roman sighed for
in vain, but an abode of sanctity and peace, prayer and labour,
study and learning, sacrifice and song, in honour of the one true
God and the ever Adorable Trinity, and for man's real happi-
neSS. In this old monastery of Glonmacnoise and elsewhere
were fully realised, in the spiritual and mystic sense, what
Virgil wrote :—

“ Conspicit ecce alios dextra laevaque per herbam,
Vescentes, laetumque choro paeana canentes,
Inter adoratum lauri nemus ; unde superne
Plurimus Eridani per sylvam volvitur amnis.
Hic manus, ob patriam pugnando vulnera passi,
Quique sacerdotes casti, dum. vita manebat,

Quique pii vates, et Phoebo digna locuti.'’
AEN. vi. 656.

But let me return from this digression to the saint and the
king. Soon after they had erected the little church and cell,
Ciaran was called to the reward of his labours.

In the year immediately following the laying of the founda-
tion, a terrible pestilence swept over the land, carrying with it
many a young, as well as middle-aged, useful and vigorous life.

 

diligence towards the Church of God, of greater daily labour before the approach
of night. He never indulged his body with leisure or idleness, he never drank
milk or ale until it was one-third water, he never ate bread until a third of
sand was mixed with it. He slept not except on the naked clay ; under his
head there was nought but a stone for a pillow; and he never ‘used linen or
woollen garments next his skin. He was a man of eminent choice merits before
God, like Abel 3 a man of earn est appreciation of the Lord, like Enoch ; a faithful
pilot of the ark of the Church amidst the waves of the world, like N oah ; a
true pilgrim with firmness of piety and saith, like Abraham ; a merciful man,
forgiving from the heart, like Moses ; a devout, patient man amidst sorrows
and tribul-ations, like the afflicted J ob 3 a melodious, delightful psalmist to God,
like David: a vessel of true wisdom and true knowledge, like Solomon ; an
immovable rock on which the Church was founded, like Peter the Apostle;
prime universal preceptor, and select vessel for proclaiming truth, like the
Apostle Paul ; a man full of the grace of the Holy Ghost, and of virginity, like
John, the bosom foster-son. It is on account of these, and many other good
deeds, that Ciaran’s soul is with the citizens of heaven. His relics and remains
are here attended with honour and reverence, with daily virtues and miracles,
and though great is thus his honour, greater shall it be in the unison of the
saints of heaven, when, in incorruptible body and soul, on the day of the great

assembly of judgment‚ as the reward of his teaching, he shall sit in judgment
with the Redeemer whom 110 served.''—Book of Lismore, MS. in R. Ι. Α., fol.
