who offered them, and saying, at the same time, that he had.

He, as I have already told yon, was arrested three times by the<
English authorities, who, on two occasions, set him at large on

the close 01 1118 days he resigned the See 01 Κ11111010, and finally
departed this 1110, September, 1607. In compliance with his,

THE ANCIENT CROSS OF BANAGHER, KING'S COUNTY.

The old Ohurch 01 Banagher, King's County, was formerly
called Kill-Regnaighe‚ the modern name is Reynagh, and the
parish in which its ruins exist, is also called Reynagh. This
parish was situated in the ancient Diocese 01 Clonmacnoise, and
now belongs to Ardagh and Clonmacnoise. It never was
separated 110111 the See 01 Olonmacnoise, although it was at times
governed by the Bishops 01 Meath and Killaloe. The church
and parish received their names in consequence 01 St. Reynagh,
otherwise Regnacia‚ Sister 01 St. F innian, who resided at Glonard,
having founded a religious house here, over which she presided
as Abbess. St. Reynagh probably died about the same year as
her Brother Finnian, ΑΛ). 563. The ruins 01 the Ohurch 01
KiH-Regnaighe stand nearly in the centre 01 the town 01
Banagher (celebrated 101· its 13118 and the old saying. “that bangs-
Banagher ’') and the enclosed space which encompasses them is
used as the parish cemetery.

In or about the year 1850, Thomas L. Oooke, Esq.‚ C.E.‚
who wrote a very interesting book entitled “ The History 01 Β111·
and its N eighbourhood,'' visited these old ruins 101 the purpose 01

hidden from the eye, by grass and weeds. This cross had been
broken, and having found only one shaff, he made inquiries as
to what had been done with the other component parts, and
where they might be obtained. His inquiries were 1111800οο88-

thing 01 the history 01 this ancient and interesting relic. Mr.
John Fahy was not then sufficiently advanced in age to know
