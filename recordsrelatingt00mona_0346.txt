116 set out, after a short time, upon his Visitations 01 that difficult
and extensive Mission, never to return to his earthly home.
Partly through excessive labour, and partly through the
extreme heat and severity 01 the climate—a climate that has
been not inaptly called‘ ‘the grave 01 Ε111οΡ63118,” 116 died
after a brief 11111688 111 the Island 01 St. Thomas, 111 the midst
01 1118 labours, and 01 the years usually given to those that die
01 016 336, having been previously fortified by the reception 01
the Sacraments. This sad event took place 111 the year 1855,
and the 1011151- -second 01 1118 age. He was buried 111 1118 own
beautiful Ohurch 01 th'e Apostles. He left by will to his
brother, then a student at IlSIaynooth College, and now the
respected ΒΡ. 01 Drumsna, Co. Leitrim, the Rev. Thomas
Monahan, his own chalice—a very large one—together with a
cruet stand and cruets, all 01 massive gold ; and his gold watch
and chain. The Colonial papers were filled with leaders 01
regret and praise. In fact, the general and spontaneous expres-
sion 01 16611113 evoked amongst all classes was equalled only by
that witnessed at the death 01 1118 kind friend, the Most Rev.
Dr. Smyth, two years before. It wffl, however, be more fitting
101· 1116 to let the present venerated Bishop 01 Roseau, the Rig ht
Rev. Dr. Michael N aughten a native 01 the Diocese 01 Meath,
and third successor 01 Dr. Monahan, speak his panegyrie. Iri
the first Pastoral Letter issued by Dr. N aughten to his clergy
and people‚ the distinguished Bishop made the following grace-
ful allusion to his memory :—

“ As 01 yore went forth the prayer 01 Ireland's youth,
calling their great Apostle to their shore, so there came from your
distant Islands a holy and venerable Prelate, Dr. Monahan, whose
ashes now rest beneath the shadow 01 the sanctuary in that beauti-
ful Church 01 the Apostles, in the Island 01 St. Thomas, having
offered up his 1116111 the cause 01 God and salvation 01 souls, on
the eve 01 1118 return to his native air, there to find a restorative
101· 1118 shattered health and constitution. But God willed it
otherw 186· when 116 was, as it were, 111 the sight 01 that land,
looking across the mighty ocean in spirit, he went to his rest
Let us hope and pray that it was the rest 01 the saints. ‘-Pre

seek 101· young Levites who would co- operate with him, fully con-

should give to the Great Pastor 101· the 801118 entrusted to his
charge3 and the more so, 11 they should be left without those
who should break to them the Bread 01 Life, and enli ghten
