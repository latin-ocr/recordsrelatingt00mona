Ganonry, which he obtained with much honour. He was made⁴
Archdeacon a few years after3 and when the Deanship became
vacant he was, after some short delay, installed as Dean of the
Chapter. It is to be observed that these honours were conferred
upon him in a stranye land, where all the members 01 the-
Chapter were and are Spaniards, except himself. So manifest
were his abilities and 11101118, 11131 directly the vacancy occurred
letters appeared in the daily papers, stating how regretable it
was that he is an Irishman‚ as otherwise he should be undoubt-
edly appointed. In due course, however, he was appointed
Dean, in spite of leis nationality, of which he is proud3 and 111
spite 01 1118 youth, for he was not then fully forty years of age.
Dean Dillon is now about forty-two years old and, therefore, 11,
may well be hoped, has a long and useful career before him.
Besides the ecclesiastical position which he fills with so much
efficiency‚ grace, and dignity, he is, moreover, a member 01 1110
Senate 01 the Spanish Republic, tle„ the Assembly of N ational
Legislators, corresponding to our House 01 Lords at Westminster.
In this position he is equally eminent and useful as in the dis-
charge of his ecclesiastical functions. He enjoys the confidence
and friendship of his Bishop on the one hand, and on the other
18 3 mata persona to the President of the Republic. He is also
the patron, friend, and adviser to the Irish residing in that
distant land of their adoption: 101 whom, as well as for his

countrymen at home, his heart and his head are employed with
an intelligent ardour.

The Very Rev. Dr. J ames Hughes, V.G. of Hartford, Oonn.‚
U.S.‚ is a native of the diocese 01 Ardagh, and his career in the
American Ghurch reflects much honour on his native land. The
compiler regrets very much that information regarding his
many great and useful works in Hartford has not come to hand
in time for sending it to Press, although materiale for a biogra-
phical sketch of him were solicited some months ago from a.
mutual friend.
