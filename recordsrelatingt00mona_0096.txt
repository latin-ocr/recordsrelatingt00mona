The Bell 01 St, Gaillin is still preserved in the parish 01
Fenagh. This interesting relic is beautifully described and
figured in “ Transactions, Royal Irish Academy,'' vol. xiv„
J 311. 7, 1822.

Ι will close this chapter by a brief sketch 01 111111 wh'o was⁴
the “decus et tutamen'' 01 Ardagh and Clonmacnoise, 110111 3
literary point 01 view—viz„ St. Colcu, or Colgan, surnamed the
Wise. He was Rector 01 Clonmacnoise 111 the second 11311 01
the eighth century. He was also Supreme Moderator and
Master 01 that celebrated school, and the author 01 the book
entitled “Scuap Crabhaigh, or the Besom 01 Devotion.'' He-
obtained the name 01 011101 Scribe and Master 01 311 the Scots
in Ireland. The year at which he began to teach in Olonmac-
noise is not registered. His eminence as 3 scholar, above all
who lectured before him and after him in that school, is beyond
all doubt. There is a curious legend, stating that St. Paul the
Apostle came in person to converse with him, and assist him 111
3 grave theological question, which was then controverted be-
tween the doctors 01 Clonmacnoise and the theologians 01
another school. Colgan, Acta 88., 20111 Feb, p. 378, has the
following record touching this alleged event ·—“ C'oluit mirum
in modum 8. Paulum Apostolum, ut suum 111 spiritu et litter-t
magistrum, et patronem singularem· ,cuj us et singulares favores, .
usque ad miracula legitur expertus. Cum enim ex scholis, dum
reverteretur, et iter 13010115 per locum, qui mointireanair apel-
latur, thecam, siv e peram, in qua ejus libri jacebant, 111 humeris.

crisque monitis et instructionibus confortasse3 quin et tanta
erga suum pium et devotum clientem dignatione ferri, quod
peram illam ex ejus humeris sublatum, ipse reliquo itinere ad
locum, quo erat venturus transtulerit. Alia etiam vice, cunr
