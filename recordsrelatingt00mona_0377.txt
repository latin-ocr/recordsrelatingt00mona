Ciborium, and usually represented by the top of the, stone
-crosses - Some think the form of this ancient shrine was adopted
in imitation of the high pitched stone roofs which covered the
ancient cells of the saints in whose memory and honour they
were made. Its material is of yew, and artistically covered with
brass-work, inlaying of ivory and enamelling. On each of its
two sides are crosses, formed in the centre and extremities by
five large cups or paterae. Underneath are to be seen figures
in bass—relief, formed of brass also and separate from each other.
The figures of one side have been lost altogether, but eleven
still remain on the other. There are fifty-two figures missing,
which filled in the other six compartments.

The vacant places in the wood of the shrine proclaim their
absence. Mr. Graves, in his beautiful essay on this shrine,
villustrated by striking and excellent photographs, which are so
valuable in connection with such a subject, observes, that he
heard on undoubted authority, the servant maid of one of its
-oenservators set to work to clean it and succeeded in scouring
»off most of its gilding. It reminds one of the fate of the OoNG

One of the figureS‚ however, is in the Petrie Collection of the
VRoyal Irish Academy, in the same room with the Orozier of
the Olonmacnoise Abbots and the Chalice of Ardagh‚ obj ects of
>much interest to the antiquary. There is also at present an-
other of these missing figures in possession of his Lordship‚ Dr.
Woodlock‚ the venerated Bishop of Ardagh.

A learned writer on this subject thus briefly describes this
shrine :—“ The Shrine of St. Manchan is a wooden chest of
>cruciform figure—that is, of a wedge resting on its base with the
-edge uppermost. The two principal sides which slope upwards
after the manner of a double reading desk, overlap both the
base and the triangular ends or gables,'’ But any description
of this shrine, minus photographic views, can convey only an
imperfect notion of its beauty. There is one figure, that of a
warrior helmeted and wearing the philibeg or kilt, which
deserves a passing notice ; for it, together with the other figures,
illustrates not only the state of the fine arts in Ireland before
the arrival of the English, but, moreover‚ proves that the use of
the kile was not confined to the Scottish Highlanders, but was
--common amongst the Irish.

Petrie tells us, in his Book on the Round Towers‚ that
Tbefore the irruptions of the Danes, in the eighth and
