Instead of the Dryads presiding over trees, every plant is now
supposed to have a vegetative soul. These various forces, at-
last, terminate in the universal idea of nature, which, though
regarded as impersonal, is supposed as acting in a sort of
motion ; as when we say: Nature abhors a vacuum. In the Posi·
tive stage, finally, the palpable facts of the phenomena are-
alone attended to, with the view of discovering the laws of
their coexistence and succession. Every other question con—

cerning them is ignored.

Every single science which can occupy the human mind must>
invariably pass through this triple stage, from the theological
through the metaphysical, into the positive. This last is des-
tined, says Mr. Mill (p. 12‚) finally to prevaiL by the universal
recognition that all phenomena‚ without exception, are governed
by invariable laws, with which no volitions‚ either natural or
supernatural, interfere. But 1116 different branches of know-
ledge do not pass from one of those stages to the other equally
and at the same time. Some sciences are more advanced than
others. Thus, astronomy, physics‚ and chemistry have already
arrived at the positive stage, whereas physiology, or biology‚
is only at the metaphysical 3 while the whole science of
humanity (sociology) is yet in its earliest stage, being hampered
with the false idea of a Providence and a God. M. Oomte’s-
division 01 the sciences deserves more praise than anything
else he has achieved. The sciences are not independent one
of the other, but are so arranged that each depends upon a pre-
ceding one less complex than 116611, whose laws it takes up
with an addition of its own, and then sends on to the science
next in order. Thus, the truths of number are true of all
things, and depend only on their own laws3 therefore, the
science of number (arithmetic and algebra) may be stated with-
out any reference to any other science. On this principle M.
Comte has arranged the sciences in a series, each term of which
is an advance beyond the term preceding it, the phenomena
belonging to it being determined by a more numerous com-
bination of laws: lst.‚ Mathematics (Number, Geometry,
Mechanics) 3 Qud. Astronomy; 3rd. Physics ; 4th. Chemistry3
5111. Biology ; 6th. Sociology, or the Social science, the pheno-
mena of which depend on the truths of all the other sciences.
Thus, all the sciences are co-ordinated3 thus, the entire edifice
rises by degrees to its last and noblest stage—the, science of man.
Thus, the experimental study of facts and facts only, is made
the secure and solid pathway to universal philosophy.

Before we pass on to consider Positivism from the religious
point of view (for to its religious bearings we intend to confine
our remarks), it may be well to observe that Comte’s system
